ReviewID	Text
1	the first room that they had us in had wet carpet so I am thinking something bad was on the carpet an they cleaned it before we got there but it was soaking wet in a large area.
1	The next room reeked of cigar smoke and had a huge air cleaning machine running in it.
1	Finally we got a remodeled room which was good but those not remodeled are are dirty looking and furniture is stained and filthy.
1	I guess what happens in Vegas...
1	happens in the bedroom and stays there.
1	The staff was great; the elevators were fast ( no waiting), lobby impressive, bathrooms nice.
2	I would stay at The Palazzo next time, since they are connected.
2	I liked my experience better there than The Venetian.
3	Been to Vegas 5 times now and definitely impressed from the outset.
3	Staff at check in were extremely pleasant and helpful.
3	We had a room in the Venezia Tower which was quite a walk every morning and evening.
3	This did not bother us one bit as the interior decor is amazing and makes a pleasant stroll to the pools and after an evening out.
3	Pool was excellent and clean.
3	Pool bar was brilliant with helpful and friendly staff.
3	Multiple large screen TVs above the bar for the sport lovers!
3	Tao pool club is just off the main pool itself and the music will be heard from the main pool area.
3	I quite enjoyed the music and the atmosphere the came with it.
3	As always plenty of places to eat in and around the hotel.
3	The best Vegas hotel I have stayed in yet...
4	Very nice, the room was comfortable, and clean.
4	The amenities were great, the pool was clean and very pretty setting.
4	So many restaurants to choice from, and friendly staff.
5	Very very great I like it
8	Great experience- spouse first time going to Vegas and she was so impressed with the hotel.
8	She felt it was visually attractive, clean, roomy.
8	If you want to impress a first timer, start with the Venetian hotel!
9	Except for the fact that yoi can't use the fridge while they charge you the resort fee a really good experience with very friendly staff, good restaurants and shopping options.
10	Outstanding hotel, great service, but the electric walkers were not operational.
11	I like this hotel as you get the feeling that you are in Italy.
11	Great attention to detail.
11	Good location and many great restaurants.
13	This place is so beautiful.
13	I will return here for sure.
17	We had a great stay here!
17	The room was beautiful, clean and comfortable.
17	Staff was very courteous.
17	The only issue we had was getting charged over $60 for the mini bar when we were extra careful to not even touch it.
17	I had to call and get it reversed and the operator made me feel like I was not honest and said they will reverse the charges just this one time.
18	The Venetian is spectacular.
18	Everywhere you look, there is something visually interesting going on.
18	Our room (the luxury suite) was gorgeous - very roomy and comfortable.
18	The bath was just the right size for lounging!
18	The Grand Lux Cafe really does have something for everyone, is reasonably affordable, and has excellent service.
18	We did try ordering room service online, which didn't work, but the hotel immediately compensated us for the inconvenience.
18	This was our first time in Vegas, and if we come back, I would definitely want to stay at the Venetian again.
19	Hotel need to provide some room in refrigerator where we can keep some personal items.
19	Not the entire fridge loaded with alcohol :) Also would have been good if the room got a microwave oven.
19	Other than these two for sure you will love this place for your stay.
20	I have stayed at NYNY, Bellagio and MGM.
20	The Venetian has the best suites, excellent restaurants, great shopping and is by far the best value for money on the strip.
22	The suite was beautiful, spacious and comfortable.
22	We had a great relaxing night.
22	A wonderful way to celebrate our 28th Anniversary :) We also got to go to Tao night club, as guests we get in free and get a complimentary drink, quite a night!
22	We must return for a longer stay next time as there is so much to do and experience!
22	The only negative is the resort fee which is compulsory as the only thing we got from it was the free Wifi.
22	We were not told what we get for the resort fee and it was only after checking online I realized we did not get the drinks coupon, the free coffee or tea, the newspaper or the access for two to the fitness facility.
22	On our next stay we will ensure we ask what the resort fee offers and make sure we get it!
23	Luxurious room; excellent strip view; Hotel/Casino has plenty to see and do.
23	Mall area has lots of shopping and restaurant choices.
23	You could spend an entire weekend just on the Venetian property!
24	This was the best hotel staff was immaculate room was beautiful and it was right on the strip will def stay again.
25	This was my third time here - twice at the Venetian and once at the Palazzo - my girlfriend and I went to celebrate our 50th birthdays and she had always wanted to stay there so expectations were high - we weren't disappointed - although it was busy with conventions, check in was still quick and since we were early (before noon) our room wasn't ready so they upgraded us to the Venezia Tower - the room, location, facilities were all top notch and the staff extremely friendly and helpful - would definitely stay there again
26	Our room was extremely clean and luxurious.
26	The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly.
26	We will definitely stay at the Venetian again.
27	this place is amazing the city alone never sleeps but the hotel is just jaw dropping.
27	the room is spacious and over the top i got the luxury suite with a view it was only a view of the mountains and pool but was still worth that little extra.
27	anything you could need can be found in the hotel.
27	would definitely stay there again.
28	full of happiness and .
28	I was there for conference but I had great time in this hotel.
29	great place its a must go and see for yourself.
30	What a lovely place to stay!
30	The staff are so friendly and genuinely happy to help and make your stay a wonderful experience.
30	I will be back again!
31	Enjoyed our stay a lot, will be a repeat customer.
32	Loved the Gondolas and the rooms, very comfortable, everything was great and unforgetable!
33	Ideal mix of workout, spa, outstanding food, shopping, shows & fun romance all in one!
34	The front desk gave me wrong room number and bothered the guest in room.
34	It was so embarrassed.
34	The hotel map is confused and out of date.
34	I can't believe this is high class hotel.
36	The only thing we weren't happy about was at check in we had requested no smoking rooms and they didn't have any, this was important to us.
36	They did upgrade us and the room was nice but smelled of smoke.
37	Nice hotel, friendly staff, good facilities.
37	I can not tell one bad worth about the hotel.
37	Nice casino only sometimes you must wait a long time for a drink.
37	Nice different restaurants, a good support for those who want to make a trip to the Grand Canyon or to a show, when you didn't book this in advance.
37	I will book this hotel again.
38	I have stayed at a few 5 star hotels in Vegas I prefer the Venetian overall.
38	The hotel offered a large selection of restaurants and shops.
38	I would stay here again.
39	The Venetian is the 7th hotel where we've stayed in Vegas and we were really looking forward to it having been all thru' the public area on numerous occasions previously.
39	What we hadnt realised until staying there is the complete lack of a quiet area just to sit and relax.
39	The only escape from the pandemonium was our suite which was of a very high standard but you don't want to stay in your room when on vacation.
39	The pool area was packed out with (padded) sun beds to the extent that there is absolutely no room for any parasols, other than the dining area, which most people would probably agree were necessary in the 118 deg temp.
39	Beautiful rooms / suites but we won't be using the hotel again
40	Very comfortable accommodation, upgraded to a better floor with city views.
40	The interior was very clean, and food was good.
41	Our hotel stay at The Venetian was GREAT!
41	It's right in the center of the strip and close to Caesar's Palace which have the Forum Mall located inside and right across the street from the Fashion Show Mall.
41	The staff was so friendly and knowledgeable when answering questions.
41	I would most definitely recommend this hotel when visiting Las Vegas.
43	In spite of being a HUGE facility, my stay was outstanding!
43	The rooms are extremely roomy, comfortable, clean and peaceful.
43	The convenience and connection to other hotels and the mall via walkways provides an added plus for shopping, casinos and restaurants.
44	We stayed at the Venetian for 3 nights and it was excellent.
44	Everything was fantastic, the room, restaurants, shows, and the staff!
44	Definitely will stay there again!
45	We are a couple in our mid thirties visiting Vegas for the first time.
45	This was a romantic get away with some relaxation and reconnection.
45	We loved our Venitian suite!
45	The bed was very comfortable, the tub was great for a relaxing soak.
45	There are 3 televisions in the room...
45	one in front of the bed, one in the sitting area and the last one in the bathroom.
45	You wont miss a thing!
45	We didn't take advantage of room service, so we can't comment on that.
45	The resort is HUGE, it took us a while to find the check in desk and then to find our room, you really can't be in a hurry when staying at the Venitian, it's so big and Grand you are bound to get lost!
45	Also, be prepared for the extra daily resort fee that the hotel charges on top of the hotel cost.
46	Need to supply at least a mini fridge (one that is not full of over priced items) for guest convenience.
46	Other than that and a ridiculous daily extra room fee, really nice experience.
47	Luxurious large room, well maintained property, friendly and knowledgeable staff - wish we were staying in Vegas more than one night!
48	Hotel is amazing rooms are big and clean central location good casino
49	The rooms are large and accommodating.
49	Avpid the rooma right next to the elevator.
49	Someone got sick outside the door and the smell lingered all night in to room.
50	It was a great vacation for my husband and I and our 21 year old twins.
50	A memory maker, for certain.
50	Hotel staff was helpful and friendly.
50	Our room had spectacular views, and the meals in the canals were very good.
50	Wish the hotel was in the middle of the strip, as we walked alot, but didn't bother us that much.
51	it's one of the best.
51	The suite was so big and wonderful.
51	The hotel itself is so huge with all the facilities you'd expect.
51	The staff were so helpful, they would guide you to whatever you wish and assist you with anything you need.
53	Had 4 days at the Venetion, and rate it 9.8 out of 10, with the ONLY small gripe was only warm water in bathroom sink, but hot in shower[?
53	]. Hotel staff in all areas were great.
53	Outstanding room, beyond beautiful facility.
54	Room was large and well organized.
54	Loved the modern style and finishings in the room.
55	The staffs were very professional, rooms were very clean and nicely decorated.
56	The Bouchon restaurant was excellent!
56	The decor, the service, and the food were incredible.
56	Kevin, our waiter was so pleasant...
57	Our original reserved room had the water shut off suddenly, reception only reacted after we called for the 3rd time asking when the water would be turned back on.
57	That is when they offered us a new room with a better view, plus a credit note for the trouble.
57	I would have not mentioned this except that for 3-4 hours we were without water and reception was not really communicating very well the water situation to us.
57	In the end we were happy.
57	Besides that issue, the second pool was closed for some reason, which caused the main pool to be crowded.
57	Overall though nice hotel.
58	Only one thin and torn blanket is given for sofa bed, and there are many holes on this blanket.
59	Great staff, wonderful service.
59	Very neat and clean.
60	Very good overall but not at nice at Pallazzo where we usually stay.
61	Everything was absolutely amazing.
61	We will definitely be staying there going forward as our hotel of choice
62	Would highly recommend The Venetian to others.
63	The logistics of the Venetia Tower required walking (and more walking, while hauling luggage), and two elevator bank changes before arriving at a very comfortable room.
63	I wasn't expecting that, especially with a late arrival when you just want to get to your room quickly.
63	Otherwise, very nice facility.
65	Hotel was best we have ever stayed in Las Vegas.
65	Room was very large with split level bedroom and lounge area.
65	It was kept clean as was the rest of the hotel.
65	Pool area was large with a number of separate pool areas, again kept in very good order.
65	Location great in centre of ""strip"" and close to other places.
65	All in all great experience in a great hotel.
66	This is our second time at the Venetian, and it will not be our last.
66	Beds situated in a raised area above the sitting quarters and business desk.
66	Large bathroom, with a huge tub and a shower big enough for two.
66	Two televisions, one in the bed area, the other in the sitting area.
66	Beds are wonderfully comfortable, nighttime blinds block the daylight, so you can stay out late, and sleep in without being awaken by bright light.
66	Hotel staff are quick to respond, our luggage was delivered within 15 minutes of arrival.
66	Valet parking is part of the Venetian experience, take advantage of it!
66	The tip you give the driver is worth not having to deal with the self parking garages.
66	Lines to check in are long, but seeing that not one resort I have stayed in within Vegas are any shorter, this is something I have just come to expect from Vegas.
67	After a disappointing stay at the Encore, I was dreading my stay at the Venetian.
67	I was ready to be done with 5 star establishments, and not looking forward to my stay at another one.
67	I am very glad I didn't cancel, because the Venetian is a much better experience than the Encore was.
67	I wish I had stayed all three nights there instead of just the last one.
68	Concierge was most helpful.
70	Except for the slow check-in, all was perfect at the Venetian.
70	Lovely room, and everything extremely clean and well-maintained.
70	Staff was very helpful and friendly.
70	Food (room service breakfast and Bouchon restaurant) was high quality and very enjoyable.
70	I would stay at the Venetian again.
72	This resort was excellent.
72	The suite we stayed in was pricey, but well worth the money spent.
72	Siena suite was far beyond what I expected.
74	People tend to speak of the negative only...
74	I must say that our stay at the Venetian was fantastic.
74	We chose this hotel because of the location to the finish line of the Rock n Roll Marathon.
74	Close and easy access was key...
74	The negative, we don't have any.
75	Very nice experience , whether within the hotel or Las Vegas as a whole ,it is a unique place, most be seen.
76	First time there and had a great time.
76	Will definitly go back.
76	Hotel was just a beautiful as the pictures.
76	It was very clean and staff were very friendly.
76	Will definitly recommend it!
77	Nice comfortable junior suite type room.
77	however, no frig for personal use so unable to chill own bottles of water or vitamin drinks.
77	the minibar is weight sensored so couldn't add things in there.
77	I found these things to be a bit inconvenient.
77	My stay was only for two nights so was able to cope.
77	Great coffee shop/bakery near the guest elevators which made breakfast easy.
78	We really enjoyed out stay at the Venetian.
78	The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable, and bathroom was large.
78	They accommodated us when we requested our room to be in close proximity to another room.
79	The Venetian was more than what we imagined, the pictures on the internet do not do it justice.
79	The easy accessibility from either direction on Las Vegas BLVD is also a plus!
79	We will definitely stay there again or at the Palazzo.
80	Absolutely amazing in every aspect and a great deal.
80	loved the restraunts and casino
84	The hotel was fabulous.
84	The room was spacious.
84	Needed a rug on the bathroom floor.
85	Great getaway from the Vegas ""buzz"" at the Venezia Pool.
85	In suite Breakfast promo was wonderful food and excellent set up.
85	Free parking all the time.
86	It is the best hotel in Vegas, very clean comfortable, beautiful, etc.
87	The staff was professional, friendly, and helpful.
87	The room was more than I'd expected, an exquisite King-sized bed, a sitting room with two televisions, a remote control with adjustable draperies.
87	The Italian-style bath had both a shower, two sinks and a garden-sized bathtub.
87	There is a safe, an iron with an ironing board.
87	There are swimming pools and various shops in which you don't even have to go out on the strip.
87	Its opulence is superb, the beds extremely comfortable.
87	Would stay in the classy place again.
88	I've been to Las Vegas five times and have stayed in five different hotels.
88	The Venetian far exceeded all of my other hotel experiences.
88	The hotel exudes luxury from top to bottom, and no expense has been spared at giving guests a five-star experience.
88	The grounds are clean, the facilities are excellent, and the rooms are awesome.
88	You really can't go wrong staying here.
89	We got married at the hotel and everything from beginning to end was efficient and really friendly.
89	The hotel has everything you will need including a spa where you can get your make up and hair done.
89	Everyone was so helpful which made the whole four days leading up fun and stress free.
89	Totally recommend it to anyone.
90	The suite was awesome,had a great time at the nascar race.
90	i had thecsmallest siute they have andca view of the strip.
90	i have been to vacation a few times but the venetian was the best.
91	nice right on the strip.
91	Needs coffee/tea service, refrigerator and microwave would be useful.
91	Love the bathroom but you need a step stool to get insdie the tub as it is high.
91	The hotel is vast so if someone has trouble with walking use a scooter provide
92	Did not want to leave!
92	We will return to the Venetian for sure!
93	I have nothing but great things to say about the Venetian.
93	I have stayed and visited other Vegas hotels.
93	however, this hotel is in a completely different category than others.
93	The staff were all very nice.
93	The room was so unbelievably gorgeous.
93	Hotel beds always give me a backache the next morning but not theirs...
93	it was such a comfortable pillow top and I felt very rested each morning.
93	I loved the shopping and restaurants that were located at the hotel.
93	Overall,  wonderful experience.
94	Hotel does not offer any great lounges or bars to enjoy a few cocktails while relaxing.
94	It does not have any of the Vegas over the top decorations.
94	The main focus of the property is shopping.
94	It's an indoor mall with all the usual stores that everyone has in their hometown.
94	Wish we had stayed at the Wynn
96	Front desk people were very accommodating and gave us a warm welcome.
96	If ever I am coming back to Vegas, I would choose the same hotel.
97	By far, the BEST customer service in Vegas!
97	Our front desk employee was professional, charming, informative, and and over-all delight.
97	Our room was nice and very comfortable.
97	The only thing I would have changed would have been to have our IPhone music hook up working properly.
97	Unfortunately, we couldnt use it.
98	Our room was in the Venezia tower.
98	"" was needed to find the bank of elevators that would get us up to our room.
98	The hotel was confusing.
98	The Venetian tower, where our friends were staying, was much easier to find.
98	The Venetian tower was closer and more convenient to the pools, shopping, restaurants, etc. of the hotel.
99	I can't say enough good things about this hotel.
99	Our stay was perfect, from the cleanliness, down to the awesome staff.
99	Will definitely be back!
100	Great food, great casino, great shops and great suites.
100	No complaints at all.
102	Great Stay-No Refrigerator Available.
102	Unable to charging in dine to the room.
102	:( Overall- great service.,
103	Only stayed one night but it was impressive in terms of decor and so on.
103	These hotels are huge so will inevitably feel impersonal.
103	The fitness facilities were outstanding.
104	It's is the second time we've stayed at the Venetian.
104	The rooms are roomy and quiet and quite luxurious.
104	The amenities (pool, gym, restaurants) are A1.
104	Access to shopping and to other hotels and attraction is the best.
104	It is located very well on the Strip.
105	Stayed in Bella 2 Queens Suite with friends.
105	My friends really liked this hotel.
105	Fridge was fully stocked with beverages including beers and alcohol.
106	Great hotel but terrible room service food and very inefficient taxi stand (only 1 employee who has to open the door for 50+ people waiting in line).
107	From the moment we stepped out of our car we were treated like we were the only guest that was arriving.
107	Staff super nice and always helpful.
107	Absolutely, wonderful experience.
107	Can't wait to go back again.
107	By far the best hotel I have ever stayed in.
109	Fabulous in most respects, however there was a long walk from lobby to guest elevators via casino, then a long walk to our room from the elevator, dont forget anything when you head out.
109	Handy little cafe at bottom of lifts and good food places in Grand Canal Shops one floor up from lobby.
109	Walk walk walk have good shoes
111	Very nice hotel with a lot of options for all.
111	Very large and getting lost is easy but staff every where to help you get to where you want to go.
111	Beautiful inside and out!
112	The hotel is one of if not the nicest on the strip.
112	Extra large rooms and exceptionally friendly staff.
112	The casino is brightly lit and doesn't smell from cigarette smoke.
112	We'll definitely go back.
113	Nice place to stay.
113	Staff are very professional.
113	Casino is very clean.
114	I loved the space in our room it was so nice and airy and big.
115	The stay was quite nice and the hotel was beautiful.
115	Remember about ""resort fees"" that get added to your bill at the end of your trip...
115	It's i. The very small print you don't notice when checking in at the grand foyer.
115	Even if you paid in advance, it's there extra ( accounted for an extra 50% of my room charge Per night.
115	For the level of opulence, the wall paper was peeling off in my bathroom, and they were doing construction in the room beside mine.
115	When I called to ask the drilling to stop in the morning, they exclaimed that it was within business hours...
115	and sorry but there was nothing they could do.
115	Others in my party paid for a room upgrade, and they too were placed directly under construction that was there every day.
115	I enjoyed my stay but felt not like a somebody, but rather just a person in a room #, helping to pay for the bright lights.
117	The facility was very nice, clean but confusing to get around.
117	Concierge staff was very helpful.
117	Internet services were down at times.
117	""Coupon"" book of values for Winter in Venice were not that valuable.
117	Gym facilities were nice.
117	Spa services too expensive--easier to get a lot more for a lot less at off the strip spas.
118	Excelent vacations in a excelent hotel, great pool, shopping and restaurants
119	We stayed at Treasure Island years ago and I always said that if I returned to Vegas I would stay at the Venetian.
119	We were not disappointed.
119	Our stay at the Venetian was wonderful.
119	We were given an upgraded suite with a beautiful view of the strip.
119	The staff was very friendly and helpful.
120	The room was more beautiful than we expected.
120	Our stay was great.
121	Overall expereience was good but the signs in the hotel was not clear.
121	Take a long walk and have to ask different staff before we can get to the Front Desk from the self parking.
121	Hotel room is clean but the bathroom ventilation need to be improved.
121	The bathroom has a strong stinky smell when we first checked into the room.
121	We have to spray fragrance to cover that smell from time to time.
123	We arrived before scheduled check in, but was accommodated with a room upgrade.
123	The room was pristine and the service was exceptional.
123	Checkout was quick and easy.
123	Overall, it was a great experience.
124	For our resort fee, how about some moving sidewalks that actually move--especially nice after a 45 minute trek in 32 C weather?
124	Found no real benefit to my IHG membership here, but spacious, comfortable rooms.
125	Not cheap but you get what you pay for !
125	Also had dinner at Lavo and it was an excellent meal !
126	as the hotel has two wings, we entered the wrong wing (not knowing this) to check in, we were checked in but had to walk a long distance to our rooms which was quite hard to find, additionally my car was valet park at the Venetian wing while my rooms was at the Palazzo wing which was a bit of an inconvenience.
126	Other than that every thing else were excellent, especially the good restaurant.
126	Highly recommend Carne Vino, although very pricey, the steaks and service were excellent.
127	Highly recommended -- easy to access all parts of the 'Strip' as fairly centrally located.
127	Would definitely stay here again.
128	loved staying at the venetian.
128	tons of options between the venetian-palazzo that can be enjoyed at all hours.
128	pool deck was great.
128	casino was clean and not overly smokey or crowded.
128	everything i needed was under one roof and i never had to leave the building.
129	The hotel was absolutely beautiful but, the upgraded cost was very disappointing.
129	I checked in and asked for adjoining room with our friends and we were told that they only had those rooms on the 30th floor but, it was a $45.00 and I asked was it a one time and I was told absolutely one time but, when came to check out time, we learned it was per night and the list goes on.
129	I will book through Expedia again but, not this particular resort.
130	I checked out MGM, Encore, Paris and more, and still found this hotel to go beyond my expectations.
130	Would only stay here when in Vegas.
131	Venetian is top notch Vegas hotel.
131	We will definitely be staying there again.
131	Large spacious and clean rooms yet the noise of Vegas cannot be heard for the times when you actually decide to sleep.
132	We checked in early and room on 4th floor could hear pounding of construction on 5th floor.
132	Changed rooms and new room was fine.
132	Large room with beautiful bathroom and living room.
133	This was our third stay at this resort and it will be our last.
133	We checked in late on June 5th (just after midnight) for a five night stay so didn't look out the window when checking in.
133	Upon waking up the next day we opened the blinds to discover that we looked out at a brick wall.
133	The room had no sunlight coming in at all and was dark and dreary.
133	I don't expect to have a stunning view but this is ridiculous.
133	I immediately went down to front desk and asked to switch rooms and was told that in order to do so I would have to pack up my belongings and move to another room with a view of the pool at a upcharge of $45 plus tax per night.
133	I told the front desk that I didn't want to pay extra for a view I just didn't want to be looking into a brick wall.
133	Front desk staff and management were not at all friendly or helpful.
133	We did end up packing up, switching rooms and paying the extra only to find out the new room had a sewage smell in the bathroom!
133	Will never return and would not recommend.
134	Service could have been better.
134	Card reader on door was not working and each time I entered the room it was a challenge just to get in the door.
135	Very clean, everyone helpful, 10 out of 10 for all you would want
136	As it was a business trip we needed wifi in our room.
136	We were not able to connect to wifi at all.
136	After several calls made we were told that the location of our room was such that the wifi is poor.
136	This was past midnight.
136	Next day the checkout process was 2 hours long.
136	It took them over an hour to get our luggage and over 45 min to get our car.
136	I did not expect this from a hotel that is rated over 4 stars.
137	We love the Venetian!
137	The rooms are so nice and big compared to other hotels with similar room rates.
137	The amenities are great and the location is so convenient on the Strip.
137	I had an excellent experience with guest services this last trip.
137	My toiletry bag exploded in my suitcase and saturated the dress I was going to wear to an event the next evening.
137	I called guest services and they had it cleaned, pressed, and returned to me in perfect condition within 4 hours!
137	We will definitely stay at the Venetian again.
139	The room had lots of room and was very nice.
139	No in room coffee or tea.
139	The sofa had the cover off of one of the bottoms.
139	Of course it was in Vegas so no view and being in Vegas did not spend a lot of time in the room.
139	Loved the remote control drapes and having three televisions (one in the bathroom).
139	The lighting in the room was not great especially in the bathroom where you need to see what you are doing when getting ready to go out.
139	Bed was very comfortable.
139	The light switch that turned on the lights on each side of the bed was just on one side and was for both lights - not good if there are two people and one wants the light on and one don't.
140	It was a very good place to stay and the hotel was in perfect condition.
140	Rooms are spacious and full of amenities
141	a hotel on the strip we great location for convention access.
141	casino is busy but fun, restaurant food was good and staff were professional and courteous.
143	Great Casino at the hotel.
143	Big pool, and easy access to Tao Beach if you are looking for a day club.
143	Walking distances from other big hotels, day clubs and night clubs.
143	Hotel is very clean, and smell great.
145	We had a great time celebrating a 50th birthday.
145	The size of the room was fantastic.
145	I wanted the hotel to know that we were there for a celebration, hoping they may provide something special in the room, a balloon, a card, anything, but received a note saying Concierge could help with any events I needed to book.
145	Other than that small disappointment, we had a wonderful stay.
146	Only one night stay but very comfortable.
146	Tao restaurant for dinner was fantastic.
147	Nice rooms and nice staff dgyddcgtdggh fdghfdvgtddchu
148	I booked an overnight to spend with family and friends traveling from England.
148	I needed an early check-in and a late check-out and both were granted no problem when I asked!
148	My room was phenomenal, a king luxury suite w/sunk in living room.
148	The view wasn't great but I wasn't there to be in my room.
148	It was more than a single person needs with 3 tv's, a business office, a luxurious bathroom and easy access to elevators.
148	The Venetian has a ton to offer from its numerous pools, to great shopping, top notch restaurants and a vibrant casino with a Sports Book that offers numerous big screen tv's!
148	It's a resort experience that covers all your wants and needs!
151	Only gripe is no access to the pools till 9am and then it is a bit of a bung fight to get in and find a chair
152	Venetian has a good middle ground of customers.
152	It is easy to get to / from and is classier than the Luxor.
153	My booking includes a $50 dining voucher to use at this Zine restaurant.
153	After the meal, I show the waiter the coupon.
153	He looked confused and said will need to check with manager as he has not seen this before!
153	After checking with the manager, he came back to said that I CANNOT use the coupon now, I will need to charge it to my room and then use it at checkout!
153	The coupon clearly says otherwise, but the waiter insists so I did not say anything more.
153	Later that night I went to the front desk to double check as it just doesn't seem right.
153	The lady called and spoke with the manager at Zine and said to me that the manager was wrong HOWEVER (this is the kicker) she cannot help me as I need to go all the way back to the restaurant to sort it myself (current time 11pm, Venetian front desk and the restaurant is at Palazzo)!
153	I said since it is not my mistake I don't see why I need to go all the way back to the restaurant to sort it.
153	Can you just sort it yourself and honor the coupon?
153	I then have to insist to speak with a duty manager to get it sorted.
153	At the end of the day, the hotel needs to let their staffs know what special they are running and HOW to redeem it.
153	And if they made a mistake, THEY NEED TO TAKE OWNERSHIP AND FIX IT AND NOT TRY TO BLAME EACH OTHER!
153	Other than this unpleasant encounter, everything else is top notch.
153	Enjoyed the stay and the food.
155	We decided to stay at The Venetian because it is in the middle of The Strip and we wanted a resort-feel and the price was great.
155	We can't wait to go back again!
155	Since the room rate was so reasonable, we even splurged and went to the Canyon Creek Spa (located in the Venetian), it was absolutely beautiful and a great way for a couple to spend some time together.
156	Although i stayed for a nighr.
156	Would of loved to stay longer.
156	Love this hotel it has akways been my favorite.
157	the best room ever, best was the bed,a dream come true, cozy living room, jacuzzi tub, seamless tub, mostly too many amenities too mention.
158	The staff was excellent is helping my find my way around, bringing up anything needed to the room.
158	The room was super clean and the bedding was awesome.
158	The check in and check out very quick.
158	THis was my first stay at the Venetian and would highly recommend this resort.
159	Great location on strip and you always feel looked after.
160	Rooms were spacious and comfortable, however really need to be refurbished.
160	Couch cushions were very worn as well as the carpet.
160	My biggest complaint was there is no refrigerator for your personal use and no coffee maker.
160	I understand the casino wants you out of the room and downstairs to buy your coffee and drinks, but it would have made my stay better if there would have been room for my cold drinks and/or coffee maker.
161	Love my experience everything was so close and the entertainment was excellent.
161	The food was great.
162	The Expedia experience was first class from initially making the booking right through to my flight home.
162	The Venetian is a quality hotel and I would recommend it very highly.
162	In addition my flight with Virgin was excellent.
163	No coffee, no refrigerator...
163	Everything is charged...
163	Some basic stuff if changed can make a huge difference
165	Excellent hotel, clean, welcoming.
166	Perfect stay, Room clean and comfortable, I had tried many hotels in Vegas but The Venetian is really the best one i had tried!
166	services are so good but there was just one problem with the Landry service; they delay to deliver our clothes for about 2 more hours after I choose the express service and payed for it.
166	everything else was perfect on this stay.
167	I think the main pool shoul be open at least until 9 pm
168	Loved staying at the Venetian.
168	It was my first time there and I had no idea how cush their rooms are.
168	The bed was so comfy, big screen tv's in bed area and living room area, separate big tubs and great shower.
168	It's the perfect getaway spot.
168	I was surprised that I really liked their casino too.
168	Some of the higher end casino's are just so stuffy, but I thought Venetian's was really great.
168	Had a lot of fun gambling there.
169	Rooms are well designed and exceptionally comfortable
171	What a pleasure it was to stay at this facility.
171	Aside from the breathtaking views the facilities are newly renovated and immaculate.
171	The staff all referred to us by name as if they knew us which felt unusual but all were warm and friendly.
171	I definitely enjoyed the spa.
171	I would love to visit again soon.
172	The room was very comfortable, some problems with housekeeping.
172	Once I telephoned housekeeping directly all problems were corrected.
172	Problem seemed to be with a language barrier and staff not speaking or understanding English.
172	Hotel had many very good and reasonable restaurants on the premises, very convenient.
172	Hotel was easy to get around not over-whelming to negotiate.
173	We had a great room
174	Upon exiting the taxi on arrival I was told to look up.
174	The ceilings all looked like they belonged in an Italian cathedral.
174	Check-in was quick.
174	The hotel has plenty of food options for all tastes and budgets.
174	Be warned - the taxi line at night can be long.
174	The casino and shops get a lot of tourists but they require a room key to get to the elevators that go to the rooms.
175	The hotel was nice, but they tried to trick me.
175	I was there on two consecutive bookings, one private & one paid for by the company, and at check-out they said I did not have any charges.
175	Since I had been warned about charges for mini-bar and opening the fridge, I thought I better go back and get something on paper.
175	And they said oh that was only for the second booking; the first booking had 2 bottles of water.
175	Their mini-bar has pressure sensors that charge you once you pick up something.
175	I had picked up the bottle to read its label to see if it was free; it wasn't, so I put it back.
175	This triggered a charge.
175	Since I did not actually take it , they took it off the bill--but they wouldn't if I hadn't gone back and asked for a printed bill; and of course, they knew that I did not take anything, since it was on the first day, and the bottle did not have to be replenished.
175	So I can only assume they tried to charge, hoping I would not notice at check-out.
176	Excellent Location to Bus Service.
176	Walgreens attached (Palazzo) makes getting the pop,snacks,liquor and incidentals very easy.
176	The only negative is the Wifi connection is average at best.
176	Spoke to others who had no connection.
177	What can I say its was the crème Della crème Room was clean very comfortable in the center of all the action on the Vegas Strip.
177	Plenty of restaurant's to choose from
178	We were at Treasure Island and the staff there was worse than 4th rate motel that rents rooms by the hour, so we moved to the Venetian and it was like night and day.
178	The ONLY thing we had to complain about was our smoking hotel room was a bit ""too"" smokey when we first arrived and we febreezed the hell out of it, as we are light smokers.
178	Also the WiFi had issues, but it was a random occurrence due to a particular convention in the hotel.
178	The staff were very apologetic and comped the resort fees of $25 a day.
178	This was more than except-able as the in room ETH jack was giving me 128 Mbps down and 135Mbps up with a 3ms ping =)
180	Beautiful, large hotel with the most comfortable mattresses.
180	Canal Shopping and Dining areas were excellent.
180	We loved our stay and would recommend.
181	The hotel is a great place.
181	Beautiful, great service, wonderful swimming pools.
182	My wife & I choose the Venetian for our 40th wedding anniversary.
182	We were blown away by the beautiful of this resort on a previous Vegas visit.
182	It was the perfect choice.
182	A stay at the Venetian will not disappoint.
182	If you like to be pampered & treated like royalty, this is the place to go.
183	The hotel is nice, but we had a hard time dealing with drunken college kids coming into the elevator all the time (coming from pool).
183	A 4-5 star hotel needs to ""manage"" its customer.
183	It can't be that we, with well paid money, have to share it with drunken kids (although I understand they want to party of course, but not in a 4-5 star hotel sharing 10 people a room).
183	We comlpained to the management and they offered perks.
183	But we decided to go back to Bellagio next time.
184	For our anniversary we stayed in a strip view Prima Suite.
184	you're right adjacent to the ferris wheel and we overlooked the strip including partial views of the Bellagio ""dancing waters"" and Mirage volcano.
184	At night it was magical.
184	The room was so spacious and had a personal twist.
184	We stay in many suites in the best hotels, Ritz Carleton, Four Seasons, and they can be sterile and cold.
184	The appointments offered warmth and style.
184	And for the price (+/- $425) you can't get a closet in NYC or Paris.
184	We'll be back for sure!
185	The hotel was amazing - wonderful luxurious suites.
185	Fabulous marble bathrooms with large soaker tubs & separate shower.
185	Really incredible restaurants & shops.
186	We stayed in a King Suite, and it was absolutely beautiful, large and very nicely decorated in the Venetian theme.
186	We could not have stayed any where nicer that I can think of.
186	It is close to all the major hotels, Wynn, Encore, Mirage, Caesar's Palace.
186	Only minutes away from the Fashion Show Mall, and of course only seconds away from the Grand Canal Shops which is an experience you just have to see.
187	The walk from the car park to check in and then to your room is as bewildering as it is long.
187	This isn't a hotel, it a shopping mall and a casino with some rooms.
187	The suites are comfortable and well appointed.
187	The shops only sell things you don't really want.
187	Time share hawkers litter the place asking how long you are staying.
187	The singing gondoliers are a nice touch and can recommend a show (La Reve was outstanding).
187	The gym was great as were the spa staff and the rock climbing wall is fun.
187	The restaurants are all disappointing except Red.
187	I'd recommend staying at the Wynn instead.
188	ExcellentThe room we stay was very nice view.
188	Before we checked in , staff recommend the room.
189	Couldn't be more happier.
189	Will definitely stay again.
189	Loved my view and thankful for our upgrade spent our 16 th wedding anniversary in your hotel was an amazing experience.
189	Staff was very helpful and friendly and service with a smile .
189	Room was perfect and very clean.
190	It's everything you expect in many ways but disappointing in small ways that make a difference when you travel a lot and compare quality...
190	It must be the only hotel I've been to that has no coffee machine or kettle, in fact they charged me $5 when I asked for a kettle.
190	Toilet shampoos etc, for 3 of us we were provided with 1 shampoo and conditioner etc a day.
190	TV great having 2 of hem but no channel guide, the safety deposit box was a silly design thin and tall so you couldn't put a laptop in it and of course the 'resort charge', most great company's and hotels just include the use their facilities in what you pay, but not here you pay extra...
190	I know they tell you this but it's just not great.
190	I get the impression that in many ways they are like a cheap airline where you have to watch the extras.
190	We had 6 nights which was a tad long with a child.
194	We only stayed here one night just for the experience.
194	The hotel was lovely, of course, and everything was clean and comfortable.
194	It was extremely pretentious, though.
194	They requested we let them hold $100 for incidentals on our card and warned that the in-room mini bar shelves were weighted and if we touched anything on it for longer than 30 seconds we would be charged.
194	Also, we took my 14 year old son to the work out room as we had done before at another resort on the Vegas strip, and the attendant said he had to be 18 even if with a parent stating that ""all other hotels on the strip were the same way"".
194	No, they aren't...
194	just at your high falutin' hotel.
194	Now we can say we have stayed at the Venetian.
194	Won't be back.
195	Had a wonderful stay at the Venetian, We usually stay at the Flamingo becuase it is centrally located and they have a great pool.
195	We did get a room upgrade becuase our room wasnt ready however they did charge us more for it when we thought it was becuase of their mess up.
195	We didnt even fight the charge the suite was beautiful and the customer service was A+
197	From the moment we entered we were impressed with the organized parking ,registration of guests and the knowledgeable, friendly staff.
197	I takes several days to get oriented and find the shortest quickest way around the hotel, however it gives you the opportunity to visit different areas.
197	Shopping, food, and entertainment is excellent.
198	The hotel and rooms are visually impressive to be sure.
198	The room was huge and very comfortable.
198	The early check in was greatly appreciated.
198	Drawbacks were lack of reasonably priced coffee or breakfast onsite and minor housekeeping issues.
198	Also, we spent 45 minutes trying to find two longe chairs out by the pool one day and finally gave up and went back inside.
199	The staff are very professional, what made the room authentic Venice was the backed up plumbing in the shower and noise coming from bathroom sinks!
201	Considering when we booked, we upgraded and upgraded again at check-in, the service did not meet my expectations.
201	The room did not deliver either...
201	water leaked from the shower everytime making the matte wet (gross!
201	) and the wall where the shower leaked was in poor condition.
201	Don't staff identify these things so a customer doesn't have to?
202	Absolutely stunning an beautiful hotel and the Piaza sweet was beautiful...
202	However, we booked a non smoking room, arrived a little early and kindly the hotel staff offered us a room since ours wasn't ready...
202	However the from we were given REEKED of smoke.
202	We were told the room floor had a smoking area but none in the room.
202	However for the most part GREAT STAY and very attentive staff.
203	Loved the hotel itself.
203	Great pools, shops, dining etc. The room was very spacious (had a suite).
203	Only minor problem was in the bathroom, the toilet paper holder was falling out of the wall and some of the wallpaper was torn and coming off the walls as well.
203	The beds were comfortable.
203	We were on the 4th floor, so we had no view, unless you consider the back alley a view...
203	but that was okay since we weren't in our room most of the day.
203	I would defenently stay here again.
204	Overall enjoyed the vacation.
204	However too much tobacco smoking smell in casino and through the air vents in the room even though in non-smoking room.
205	Great location on the strip.
205	Walking distance to a lot of good places.
205	Plenty of things to do for the whole family.
206	We enjoyed the hotel, restaurants, Bouchon Cafe, and the canal shops very much.
206	We stayed for 3 nights and slept well the first 2 nights.
206	On our last night, we could hear kids noisily playing way past midnight.
206	We tried but couldn't sleep, and called the front desk.
206	They sent security up to deal with it, which was very effective.
207	The Venetian was a great place to stay.
207	It was centrally located.
207	My only complaint was the hallway.
207	Food trays with food and trash was left outside the room across the hall for two days.
207	It was a weekend but this should have been picked up.
208	Great Hotel, wonderful rooms, delicious restaurants, makes you feel as if you are in a dream.
208	Full enjoyment of eating & shoppig too.
208	Had a wonderful stay again and always will be my favorite in Las Vegas !
209	The suites are incredible!
209	There are lots of dining choices located in the hotel.
209	It is a beautiful choice!
210	Fun time, we enjoyed the canal shoppes and the pool
211	I always stay at This hotel because it's location and excellent service.
212	This is our second time at the hotel and again, the place is great.
212	go to the concierge desk and they'll give you the inside scoop on what shows to see and which ones to stay away from.
214	we enjoyed our stay there it was a nice clean attmosphere with lots to do
215	While there isn't enough nice things to be said about the rock star staff they employ, the hotel itself is starting to show it's age.
215	The wallpaper in my room was starting to peal a bit, and there was a huge stain on the wall near the table.
215	When I mentioned it upon checkout, while they apologized they didn't seem surprised or really concerned.
215	While it's a nice hotel ran by amazingly friendly people, there are just too many other options that are as good yet cheaper.
218	Overall I had a great time.
218	I just had to call a few times for towels, and request for my room to be cleaned the next day.
219	This was our first time in Vegas - we didn't go to gamble but had a really great weekend just people watching and wandering the strip.
219	So much to see and do, fabulous restaurants and such friendly people.
219	Took in a concert at the Cosmopolitan, great venue.
219	Took a bus tour through "" Pink Jeep Tours "" to Hoover Dam - worth every penny.
219	Our tour guide was very knowledgable and pointed out lots of sights along the way.
219	When staying on the Strip be sure to purchase a 2 or 3 day pass on the "" Deuce "" well worth it - hop on and off transit.
219	The "" next hotel / block "" isn't as close as you think.
219	Would go back again but for a few extra days, we were only there 3 days and felt it was not long enough.
220	We were in a recently remodeled room.
220	Beautiful hotel with many food choices.
220	Casino was not as nice as some of the other hotels.
221	Lighting in bathroom very poor
222	Odyssey discovering all of the various niches within the big empire of the Venetian
223	Beautiful setting and convenient; felt very secure.
224	Me and my wife had a great time during convention time.
224	Venetian has it ALL from Shoping, great dinning, clubs, gondola rides, spas and etc. You practically need a week to go trough everything under the roof and still won't be bored.
224	We will be coming back soon to Venetian as this is our favorite place on the strip!
225	pure luxury totally spoils you
226	This hotel was GREAT!
226	Perfect for a romantic get away for 2 or a family of 6. Loved everything about the Venetian
227	The Venetian is an absolutely beautiful hotel!
227	Super fast elevators during anytime of the day or night.
227	The staff were all very friendly, efficient, and quite helpful.
227	One day the house keeping staff forgot to replenish our towel supply; I simply called house keeping and they were delivered to our room within 10 minutes.
227	We ordered room service one night - I didn't care for the entree that I ordered, and my friend's Caesar salad with grilled chicken didn't have any chicken on it.
227	I called the in-suite dining services; they offered several solutions, but I just asked for the cost to be taken off my bill, which they did without question.
227	Those were the only 2 ""incidents"", (if you can call them that), that we encountered during our 5 night stay there.
227	Our suite was very spacious; from the bathroom with a TV in it, to the double queen beds, to the sunken living room.
227	So many shops, restaurants, exhibits, kiosks, etc. right there on site!
227	I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!
228	I stayed in Venezia and the room was too far away and confusing (two different elevators) to get.
229	Fun hotel to stay at.
229	Nice rooms and great service.
229	Pool was nice but very cold.
229	Good restaurants and a close walk to anything needed.
230	Stayed one night on Oct 26 and thought the hotel was beautiful and very clean.
230	Hotel staff were very friendly.
230	Great vibe at the casino.
230	Would stay here again.
231	This was the best time I've had in Vegas,ever!
231	Truly enjoyed everything the hotel had to offer
232	Room on the 28th floor with a fantastic view.
232	Suites are of two levels with plenty of space to entertain a cocktail with friendsPool;facilities are great with plenty of chairs for everyone to enjoy
233	We had great time during our stay, we spend 1 night a Venetian suite.
233	We had special access to a pool which was amazing.
234	The Venetian is a beautiful-high-class hotel.
234	The suites are remarkable, the pools are well designed and the gym is very professionally equipped.
234	The best part though is the shopping area, designed like the real Venice with a great verity of stores.
234	If you're looking for a great place to stay in Vegas this is the one.
235	The only big problem was at night the working elevators kept waking us up.
235	Every time it went up or down it woke us up.
236	Arrived Friday night tired from trip.
236	Didn't do anything but relax, room was not up to standard.
236	Towels had makeup, shoe polish stains on several .
236	Also, found a roach in the shower bathroom area.
236	Notified staff and was moved to another room and higher floor.
236	Service and room forward was great.
237	Really enjoyed all about the hotel.
237	Only complaint is housekeeping did not leave us wash cloths for 2 days.
238	My husband and two older teenagers (15 and 18) greatly enjoyed our stay.
238	We had a 2 queen suite which was very roomy.
238	The bathroom was massive and beautifully appointed.
238	Fitness facility was clean and we enjoyed the group exercise classes.
238	Hotel Staff was friendly and helpful.
238	We would definitely stay again
241	Rooms are lovely just a shame that the housekeeping staff don't service them better.
241	Personally feel that this hotel is overpriced for the level of service we received especially as you have to pay the resort fee of 25 USD   tax on top when you get there.
241	When we return we will stay somewhere else and spend the money on something else as we really didn't think it was worth it especially when you look at the standards of some of the other hotels in comparison.
241	Also no tea/coffee facilities in the room however I understand that this is the same for all Vegas hotels but I still think this is really poor.
242	It was fantastic in every way enjoyed spa services.
242	The whole experience was great.
243	My kids love the big Christmas tree outside the hotel.
244	Needed a getaway with the wife.
244	Perfect place to stay.
244	We will going back in November
245	First time staying at the Venetian.
245	Would definitely recommend to anyone, it is the best end of the strip and location is perfect for shopping with the fashion mall across the street.
245	The atmosphere in the casino was great with a good vibe every night.
245	Beautiful hotel with great rooms and service.
245	Does not get any better.
247	I stopped over in vegas with my wife and two kids from a long trip from Moan Utah.
247	The suite was very clean and well arranged.
247	The hotel staff took time to arrange the table for the in-suite dining.
247	Table setting was beyond expectation, I still cannot forget the look on my wife's face when she came from the long bath.
247	The hotel was very quite and managed to rest well.
247	Excellent restaurants in the casino floor.
247	This hotel offers good value for money.
247	The hotel escalators needs optimizing as u may wait for quiet some time esp during the morning rush hour or very late evening.
248	We stayed here for 3 nights and were just blown away with how beautiful the hotel was and how large it was!
248	Anything you wanted to do  you could do right there in the hotel.
248	The pools were amazing and the views from the pools were awesome!
248	Our room was very spacious.
248	We were with a group of 6 and there was plenty of room in each room for us all to hang out and relax together before going out for the night!
248	The view from our room was also beautiful!
248	Loved the atmosphere of the ""outside in Italy"" feel as you walked through all the shops and watching the gondolas!
248	We enjoyed our stay here and would definitely be back!
249	Nice large rooms, looked like it wasn't stayed in for awhile so was quite dusty but other than that good overall stay.
249	No late checkouts though were available
250	The most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in!
250	Rooms were exeptionally clean and spacious.
250	Friendly staff throughout the entire resort.
250	Came across the best bartender in the world (Joe I) at Wolfgang Puck Postrio!
252	A mega room, quite comfortable, however, there are crowded of people and noisy lobby
253	So luxiourous and so beautiful overall.
253	The best location and the canal shoppes with the gondols are great and beautifully!
253	Best hotel on the strip.
253	I can recommens the garden pool much more nice and not so crowded as the big pool.
253	Only thing I miss is more service by the pool.
253	A five star hotel should get cold towels to the guests by the pool and offering them free drinks and so on.
254	I like this hotel.
254	Kind of romantic with gondola rides going through and hearing the singing in the square.
254	Has that European feel.
254	Rooms are really nice.
254	Little bigger than what other hotels offer you in Vegas.
254	I've stayed at Aria and Vdara and I prefer rooms at Venetian.
254	I like the Casino.
254	Enough Action but not too much.
254	Drink service was off and on.
254	Seems waitresses kept their heads forward not looking to service many people.
254	There were times hours went buy with no service.
254	Wifi was pretty decent from all areas.
254	We ate at the sports bar Lagasses Stadium.
254	Restaurant was dead so it wasnt that they were busy.
254	We also had dinner at Canaletto.
254	Food was really bad.
254	My background is Italian, so I might have a bit of an expectation when it comes to Italian food.
254	But this was almost inedible.
254	Feel was pretty good being in the square though.
254	That was the only thing I liked about being at Canaletto.
254	To sum it up, Room was great.
254	Casino and hotel are great.
254	Shopping area is nice.
254	Food is poor and needs work.
254	But with food, at least for me.
254	I like to get out and see a little Vegas.
254	Check out different hotel dining so it didnt bother me too much.
254	I give it 4 stars.
254	As an aside, check out Scarpetta at the Cosmo for some good Italian.
254	Check out Olives for lunch and sit out on patio.
254	Both look over Bellagio fountains and both have excellent food.
255	Fantastic hotel, highly recommend.
255	No tea and coffee facilities in the room though and no space in the fridge for our own drinks and nibbles.
256	I had a very very good time what a way to bring in my 44th Bday 5 star all the way
258	I went last week to Las Vegas and staying at this magnificent Hotel, beautiful paintings all over the walls, the private pool is amazing although its small( didn't have time to see the main one) the problems we had, we have to walk a long way and change the lift to get to our room, and there is a  charge $25 each day for the wifi & gem even if you don't use it and this was not mentioned when we booked it.
258	No tea or coffee provided in the room, you have to order it or take the breakfast in one of the cafe's in the hotel
261	This resort was true luxury.
261	The rooms were comfortable, clean.
261	The bed was amazing.
261	The service at the resort was fabulous.
261	Very nice and helpful, always smiling.
261	Thank you for a perfect vacation away with my husband!
262	Loved the chapel and the gondola.
264	Stayed in a suite and it was amazing.
264	The restaurants were so good.
264	Overall a great experience.
265	Can't complain about the hotel except it's really big and one can get lost easily.
265	The hotel staff are really nice and friendly.
265	Aquavana at The Canyon Ranch Spa is highly recommended.
267	Great property, typically over-the-top Las Vegas style.
267	Probably the only negative is its so busy, people everywhere it can seem like you're in a shopping centre on Christmas Eve.
268	proves that it is possible to go to a casino resort hotel and not have to partake in the casino!
268	the only problem, and this is more about the whole city, there is a lingering smell of cigarette smoke
269	I strongly recommend this hotel, everything in it is fabulous fom the entrance to the room, you have everything you r looking for in this hotel: shops, restaurants and bars...
269	We loved the pool.
270	If you want to walk a 1/4 mile & take 2 elevators to get to room, this is the place for you.
271	Very pleasant experience , and a great hotel.
271	Nice location and good facilities
272	This place is gorgeous.
272	The room was comfortable, clean and very inviting.
272	I almost hated to leave it.
272	One small complaint was the sound of air rushing under the door.
273	Very polite customer service.
273	Rooms were clean and organized.
273	They also have late check out with $50 more.
273	That helped us instead of paying half of day.
273	Will definitely go again and recommend it to everyone.
274	I wasn't satisfied with the first room I had, so I called down to the front desk and wanted to change rooms.
274	She told me I couldn't move until the next day because the hotel was full...
274	Hmm, that's funny, because the desk agent wanted to upgrade me to another room when I checked in...
274	for $150 PER NIGHT upgrade.
274	I had a view of a wall - really?
274	no charging station...
274	I had to crawl under the desk to find outlets to plug into-- again, really?
274	I went down to the front desk and Felix was able to move me to the Venezia Tower for no charge!
274	Had a great view of the strip and the Volcano at the Mirage!
274	Housekeeping did not tidy my room on Friday.
274	When they were in my hallway, I told them I would be leaving in an hour and could she come back.
274	yeah, she never  came back.
274	didn't have my room cleaned until Saturday.
274	Not a big deal, I could have called housekeeping.
274	If they didn't come on Saturday, I was going to call.
274	it wasn't that they didn't replace they towels (i use them more than once) but I had food in the trash barrel that needed to be thrown out.
275	The room was very spacious and I love the sectional on the living room area.
275	I love the bathroom.
275	It was the best stay we've had in Vegas!
276	Bathroom shower has  Bad water pressure and the fixtures are loose and Rattalee.
276	I ordered more towels and was told I could only have two extra a day?
276	Pool area was jammed, friends bag got lifted and rifled through and luckily we found it in the bushes.
276	The crowd is not five star, they are like allowing six or seven people to a room.
276	Public bathroom in casino level for women section all needed new toilet seats, shops are good,
277	Enjoyable experience; thoroughly enjoyed the Michael Jackson One and Human Nature shows.
277	Appreciated being on the strip and able to walk to many other hotels and venues.
277	The weather was great.
278	Had a great time for a weekend gateaway.
278	Everything was as expected
279	Overall experience at the hotel was alright.
279	Took an hour and half for a bags to come to our room when we first arrived when then said it will be up in 15 minutes.
279	Our bathroom sinks (both of them) were completely clogged when we used it.
279	When informing front desk they weren't apologetic at all.
279	The maintenance staff who came up was more apologetic than the front desk.
279	Overall, our room wasn't the cleanest and it was bit disappointing.
279	The hotel itself is very lovely but  I don't think I would like to stay there again.
280	This is one of my favorite hotels in Vegas.
280	The rooms are spacious and well furnished.
280	Service is at its best!
280	There was a promotion for breakfast that was room service breakfast!
280	I would rate 5 stars but the only gripe is this resort fee.
280	I am paying for a hotel room and have to pay extra to use wifi and the pool- that they own?
280	that a rip off sorry!
281	This hotel was amazing.
281	I wouldn't usually stay at a place this nice but the last minute aka night before deal was great.
281	Just wish I would have had more time to enjoy the hotel and check out the pool.
283	Awesome stay, great room, food and atmosphere!
283	Rooms were clean, beds comfortable
284	It was awesome except for a couple small issues!
284	Room service was outstanding!
284	Everyone was courtious and prompt.
284	A couple issues: A box of condiments was already openned but we alerted them and were not charged; room was mostly setup to accomidate deaf people except there was no doorbell with flashing lights and phone flashing lights (which they said was in the room).
285	Critically located nice hotel on the strip.
285	Rooms are clean and have a nice fitness center as well.
285	What I did not like about this hotel as with any other vegas hotel is that I have to go through the casino to go to the rooms.
286	It was a very nice hotel, but the overall Casino was just ok.
286	The room was great, but did our gambling in other hotels.
286	If you are a player, I would recommend staying at another property.
288	The Venetian just isn't what it used to be.
288	We've been staying here for more than 6 years for our wedding anniversary; this will be our last time.
288	While the fine dining restaurants are fabulous, the bar staff & the smaller fast food places have lost the idea of customer service.
288	Elevators and escalators not working or being worked on for the 5 days of our stay, the casino not as clean as it should be.
288	We were placed in the new tower, 2 elevator banks to get to the room…not to mention the walking distance to our room.
288	We've already book Aria for our next trip.
289	Hotel is right on the centre Of the strip walking distance to everything.
289	Huge hotel, amazing casino, great restaurants, great club called Tao and the most comfortable bed ever.
289	The rooms are very spacious and bathroom is spacious too!
289	Really enjoyed our stay at the Venetian and would return any day!
290	The room, the staff, the shops and the restaurants.
291	I wouldn' recommend this hotel to whoever is thinking about staying here.
291	The room was absolutely GROSS.
291	We had to change suites 3 different times.
291	I was so rnraged that i asked to speak to the front desk manager who's name was Devin from CT.
291	He assured me he waive the 30.00 a day resort fee which when i checked out was the fee wasn't waived .
291	Overall just a loysy experience here and i would never suggest thr venetian.
291	Wynn encore is a better choice .
292	I feel a littler inconvenient is that the room only has a thick heavy blanket, is not like Encore Wynn hotel they also provide a little thin blanket for the TV room.
292	They also provide two complimentary passes to the buffet when we stay tree nights.
293	All staff friendly and helpful...
293	loved the shopping at the hotel...
294	Upon arriving, checking in was quick and easy.
294	The staff is very friendly and accommodating.
294	The rooms were huge and the bathroom was large, but for 4 guests in one room, the glass shower made it difficult for one person to shower while one person wanted to do makeup or use the bathroom.
294	Also, there is no fan in the bathroom, so it was always very steamy after a shower; however, the many mirrors and extra vanity with seat was a nice touch.
294	The pool was large and beautiful, but the pool in Tao beachclub is very tiny and the drinks (we had margaritas) were awful; however, Tao beachclub is right next to the actual large pool.
294	The hotel's location is AMAZING!
294	Right next to Encore and Wynn.
294	The casino was awesome and classy.
294	Guests must cover up, so people cannot be walking in and out in their bathing suits, which I find to be uncomfortable.
294	The blackjack dealers were very personable and the waitresses were polite.
294	We ordered room service one day and it is expensive but delicious.
294	If you're going to dine in the Venetian, I would reconsider and make the short walk to the Palazzo, which has better dining.
294	Overall, the Venetian attracts a bit of an older crowd, or maybe our group was just young in comparison (21-22 yrs), but the large suite and prompt maid service is amazing and great for groups of friends and is not going to break the bank.
294	No one complained about us playing music or being too loud, but we were definitely one of the younger groups there
297	We had fun at this hotel.
297	The rooms could be a little cleaner.
297	But all in all it had everything we needed to have a good time.
297	Love the architecture and gondola.
298	We have stayed at the Venetian and the Palazzo many times.
298	This tripWe stayed in the Venetian.
298	It is always excellent!
298	The rooms are extremely large...
298	Like a mini luxury apartment.
298	We have two teenagers so the room size makes a huge difference!
298	Everything is always top notch in this 5 star hotel.
300	Excellent, classy hotel with great attention to customer service.
303	Wanted a place worthy of a 40th birthday, center of excitement, close to other attractions, clean, beautiful and worth it!
303	will 1000% stay again.
304	Stayed 3 nights for our anniversary.
304	The room was perfect.
304	Was very expensive but definitely the best hotel on the vegas strip.
304	Lots of choices for dinner.
304	Loved the pool area.
304	The water was very warm though.
304	Drinks at the pool were very expensive to.
304	We paid 23 dollars for a beer and a frozen mixed drink.
304	But that was every where too.
304	The pool can get very crowded and hard to find an open chair.
305	This was the second time that we stayed in this hotel and I still want to keep coming back.
305	It is very nice and very elegant.
305	The pools were great.
305	The environment is just awesome.
305	Lots of nice restaurants and close the mall.
306	1st Vegas trip great room casino and staff loved it.
306	I'LL BE BACK!
307	No bell boy service and guests have to carry their bags finding long way to room.
307	No amenities inside room such as water port nor mug cups except two wine glasses are free.
307	Have to pay additional $25 + tax daily to the hotel for gym and pool even though not used.
308	The Venetian is fabulous & truly all- inclusive!
308	It has superb suites...
308	upscale restaurants along with moderately priced on-the-go eateries.
308	Shop choosing from high-end boutiques or familiar stores.
308	Enjoy activities like a romantic moonlight Gondola ride or check out the amazing Peter Lik gallery.
308	Take photos with the stars in the awesome wax museum or walk the interior & exterior of the hotel capturing the opulence of the Venetian...
308	not a bad photo to be had...
308	At days end relax in the lush garden pool area jacuzzi or take a swim to refresh your spirit.
308	Your trip will not be complete until your dance till dawn at the sleek club Lavo!
309	The Venetian is a good hotel, with the common areas being the best part.
309	The grand canal is always a crowd pleaser.
309	I have to say, though, after being in operation for 15 years, the interior finishing is starting to show its age.
309	Too many coats of paint, and furniture that is a bit dated.
309	For over $200 a night, I would have expected better.
310	The hotel has absolutely everything you need in Vegas -- food, drink, & entertainment - under one roof.
310	The reception and checkout were both quick and painless.
310	The room was amazing and had a nice view toward the mountains.
310	We did the Cantina (expected a bit better) and the Cut (an amazing experience).
310	Finally, I was amazed that a hotel of that size with the volume of guests could be as clean as it is.
311	The Bouchon Bistro was fabulous.
311	The staff was extraordinary, which made our dining experience even more pleasurable!
313	Hard remembering how to get to room from lobby at first...
313	felt like a maze, but we got used to it.
314	We had been on great Vegas Hotels like Aria, Cosmopolitan, Bellagio and others, but the Venetian has the BIGGEST ROOM ever (separate sofa with an extra tv) , super clean room, nice bathroom, SUPER NICE STAFF, pools are great, excellent night club (TAO is terrific)I have bad luck with the view (it happens sometime if you don't ask for a GREAT view, and they are nice enough to give to you for free)  but still great room.
314	now the BAD part: I don't know if it was a temporary problem , but the CASINO has a SUPER STRONG SMOKING ODOR, and I know it is a ""normal""  thing , but again it was THAT strong that I think is out of normal.
314	they need to have some kind of smoke extractor , or old filter...
314	I don't know...
314	totally out of normal.
314	and the best example is the PALAZZO casino (right next to the VENETIAN) had a very ""NORMAL"" odor.
314	Now remember the ODOR problem was ON THE CASINO, not on my super clean not smoking room...
314	Housekeeping is incredible, super smooth all the time, no noise at all, and always so friendly and educate.
315	We could have had a slightly better view (were warned), but other than that the room was huge, clean and beautiful.
315	The amenities of the hotel / casino were very nice and easy to navigate.
315	Plus the location on the strip is ideal.
316	Room was spacious with good layout.
316	Nice and clean, and timely room service each day.
318	A great experience well worth the cost.
318	My husband & I thought it was one of the better hotels on the strip.
318	Especially good for New Year's EveCelebrations.
319	We stopped in a king suite and it was excellent comfortable and had everything we needed and more.
319	Staff were always extremely helpful throughout the hotel at all hours of the day.
319	Has excellent facilities as well.
319	Will definitely be returning here would not stop anywhere else in Vegas now.
320	I have stayed at hotel .
320	Ac unit was loud and made a humming noise all nite.
320	I checked into Venetian.
320	Was two queen beds.
320	I requested king bed.
320	Had to switch to palazzo .
320	Both hotels are showing there age.
320	The staff was great.
320	Room was always clean.
321	It suppled all the amenities that added up to a first rate Vegas experience
323	I have stayed in a number of nice places and seeing that this was suppose to be a five star resort style location, I booked.
323	I wish I would have gone with my instinct and paid a little extra for the Wynn.
323	A few upgrades and remodeling it can be restored to a five star.
324	The hotel was nice, but not as nice as some of the other hotels I have stayed at in Las Vegas.
324	We were only there for a couple of days, so I did not pay for the upgrade to get a better view.
324	This was probably a mistake because the view from the room was awful!
324	All we could see was a huge gray wall and some service areas with the Mirage/Strip in the far distance.
324	Additionally, there was a huge fight in the hallway right outside our door at about 7am the morning we were leaving.
324	Something I wouldn't expect in this hotel.
324	Security did respond quickly, but the hotel didn't even apologize for the inconvenience it caused us on our last morning.
324	Overall, the room is nice, but I would stay at the Bellagio or even Treasure Island before I would stay at the Venetian again.
325	Really nice resort, although did find it a bit difficult to navigate due to the sheer size of the resort, top location situated centrally on the strip.
326	Awesome place with great amenities.
326	I would recomend to anyone who's going to Vegas.
327	This was our fourth stay at the Venetian.
327	We love the accomodations.
327	The staff is wonderful.
327	They cater to your every need.
327	The food is great.
327	Looking forward to our next stay.
328	This is the best hotel to stay in when you're in Las Vegas.
328	It has everything and more.
328	The rooms are amazing.
329	Hotel really big and you need to walk everywhere.
329	Hotel does not have refrigerators or microwaves in suite.
329	If you have family needs, diabetic or recovering alcoholic...
329	In suite refrigerator is stocked with liquor and you are charged for each item that is lifted out of refrigerator.
330	Because we are priority club platinum members they delivered a very nice fruit basket to us and we left the dirty dishes on the table and the maid just left them there our entire stay!
330	Other than that everything was great
331	Drove into Vegas after visiting Sedona and the Grand Canyon.
331	Never been to Vegas before and booked the Venetian due to friends recommendations.
331	We mainly went to see what it was all about and see a Cirque de Soliel show.
331	We do not gamble.
331	Hotel and room were beautiful.
331	The casino smelled like cigar and cigarette smoke.
332	Excellent pool in VeneziaLove the Grand Canal ShoppesBeautiful room.
332	Beware of hidden fees
334	My daughter & I stayed the weekend in Vegas and we wanted clean, classy, entertaining and a smoke free room.
334	We got that and so much more at the Venetian.
334	Great price and the suite we stayed in was perfect.
334	The bedding was very nice and the view of the pool just topped off our stay.
336	Got it as a Expedio deal when went for  5* North Strip hotel.
336	No Coffee facilites in room but plenty around the hotel or 2 Starbucks outside.
336	Used the Walgreens supermarket at the front of hotel for snacks and drinks.
336	Denny's just being built next door.
336	Wifi ok in room but struggled for a signal around the pool.
336	Airport to Hotel via taxi was around $25.
336	Grand Lux cafe is excellent .
336	Wait for a  front table if you like people watching.
336	Would definely stay again .
338	I had a great stay.
338	the people were so nice.
338	An alarm to everyone going to the cream shops.
338	they will try to sell u creams at 100 to 200 dollars a cream,when you can purchase them online between 40 and 60 dollars a cream.
339	The hotel was lovely, the Christmas decorations were incredible.
339	The casino was bright and did not smell of smoke.
339	One of the days our room was not made up and that was 5:00 in the evening.
339	We called housekeeping to let them know clothing was left from a previous guest and they never retrieved it, until a third call was made.
339	It was good but the attention to detail lacking.
339	The shops over the top.
339	I would stay here again, I like it 's location, but I might try Wynn next time.
341	It was my first time to Vegas and this was my favorite hotel.
341	We stayed at another hotel but wanted to try one of the big ones for our last night and picked the Venetian.
341	I loved everything about this place.
341	From the design, to the shops, and the hotel room itself; I didn't want to leave.
341	The girl at check in was super nice and gave us lots of tips and pointers since it was our first night with them.
341	The room we had was a king suite and it was very nice.
341	I enjoyed the sunken living room that was sort of separate from the bed area.
341	There were 3 tv's in the room (bedroom, living room and bathroom), a big bath tub with a separate shower and I also like it when the toilet is in its own little closest.
341	That way I can still be in the bathroom doing something if my hotel roommates need to use the facility.
341	Room was clean, and beds were comfortable.
341	I also loved that the room had a remote to control the window drapes and the curtain; and that the curtains were complete block to the sun to make it black in the room in the morning.
342	THE HOTEL WAS FABOLOUS.
342	I COULDN'T IMAGINE STAYING ANYWHERE ELSE.
342	THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T LIKE WAS THERE IS NO MICROWAVE IN THE ROOM.
342	NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO EAT AT THE RESTAURANTS.
342	:((THE REFRIGERATOR WAS STOCKED FULL, SO NO ROOM FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL BEVERAGES.
342	SHOULD BE AN OPTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT THE FRIDGE STOCKED OR NOT.
343	Hotel was beautiful and maintained wonderfully.
343	Felt safe & comfortable.
343	If you are looking for a casino with excellent waitress service this is not the place - was in the casino for 3 days and never got served!
344	It was my first time to las vegas, and to be honest I left very happy, my wife and I would like to go back.
344	Room, lobby, and all the other areas was very nice.
344	I give the Venetian Hotel 5 Stars.
345	My wife and I just got back from Vegas and we stayed at The Venetian.
345	It was all that we expected it would be.
345	Check in was fast and the staff was very nice.
345	The suites are spacious and lovely.
345	My wife didn't want to leave.
345	and the location was very good.
345	parked and didn't get in our car again until we left really was no need to rent one.
346	This was my 3rd stay in Venetian.
346	I always liked the ambience and venetian hotel in general.
346	But this time I was totally disappointed by the bed and the service,* Bed was too soft and looks like it was sagging at headboard side and I started getting neck ache* Pillows were so hard and tall that I had to throw them away and sleep without them* We were given a room with pull out sofa bed besides the regular king bed.
346	There was no blanket, when I asked for one I was given a flimsy light blanket that could not keep heat.
346	Next night I asked for extra blanket which promptly arrived.
346	Next day morning I saw the blanked had bunch of holes in it.
346	I guess venetian is getting older and I need to look for newer hotels
347	Beautiful grounds and interior.
347	Good food available near by.
347	Room were nicely decorated.
349	;My recomendation is to improve the confornt of the bed
350	The room is very comfortable and quiet.
350	The free breakfast and service is excellent.
350	The location is in the heart of Strip street.
352	I stayed for one night with three of my girl friends and we had a blast.
352	The hotel is beautiful and our room was spacious, clean, and luxurious.
354	So many food and shopping within the hotel premises and accessible to the strip.
355	The location was great.
355	The activities were many during the time we were there.
355	Staff at front desk was very helpful.
355	The bathroom in the luxury room we were in was fantastic.
355	We felt like we were in a palace.
355	The minibar items were very reasonably priced, we found the prices to be the same at restaurants outside the hotel.
355	The negative were that our room windows could not open, so I didnt feel we got fresh air, although the hotel air system was excellent and was very quiet.
355	The bathroom toiletries werent too many and seemed inexpensive.
357	Stayed for seven nights.
358	The Venetian/Palazzo was fantastic.
358	The rooms are huge and state of the art.
359	Fabulous and classy is the best way to describe this hotel!
360	In 30 years my husband and I have never taken a vacation just the two of us.
360	Because of this we wanted to stay somewhere a little bit nicer than average and the Venetian did not disappoint.
360	Even though we spent a little more on our room than what we normally would, we felt spoiled and enjoyed our stay at Venetian immensely.
360	It was well worth it.
361	Really enjoyed our stay here, its so beatiful and clean.
361	The staff is helpful and friendly.
361	Will stay here again on our next visit to Vegas!
362	The staff were very helpful answering our questions ...
362	The hotel itself didn't supply much information.
362	It would have been helpful to have bus routes, more detailed spa info and shuttle information to  and from the airport.
363	The room deserves 5 star.
363	I absolutely enjoy the stay in this hotel.
364	Luxury King Suite was awesome.
364	The view was ok, not bad, but not fantastic.
364	Would definitely stay here again, however may not pay to upgrade the room to include a ""view"".
365	Room was clean and very comfort.
365	We like the Grand Canal and had a lot of fun with my kids.
367	Venetian was clean and comfortable.
367	Close to monorail station and good overall location.
367	Only complaint is that the escalators for Las Vegas Blvd.
367	entrance were not working and did not look that there was any intention to repair.
368	Big and beautiful rooms.
368	It is so big that it can get confusing at times.
368	We  stayed at the Venezia wing and we got lost many times because we either couldn't find our way out or our way to our room.
372	First time in Las Vegas and we went with one of the best hotels the strip had to offer.
372	Probably wouldn't ever downgrade from this hotel.
372	It was amazing throughout the whole building.
372	It was also great that it was connected to the Palazzo Hotel which made for even more things to do.
372	I wish I could go to Vegas every weekend and stay at this awesome hotel.
373	The Venetian is a wonder resort and spa.
373	The place had everything from shopping, dinning , entertainment.
373	It is a great place to vacation of experience a quick get away.
374	our first time in Las Vegas, Winter in Venice was a wonderful experience ,friendly people, the entertainers were fantastic ,the *elves* serving apple cider in lobby was a nice touch.
374	the decorations in the palazzo were beautiful.
374	There were lots of shops and restaurants.
374	the casino was bright and inviting.
374	the gondola ride was relaxing.
374	the mimes were awesome.
376	Lots of choice of restaurants.
377	The casino was too light...
377	i felt as tho I was at Disney.
377	The hotel and casino and the staff were wonderful and we had a great time.
377	We walked around other casinos and preferred the lower lighting.
377	When we returned to the Venetian the lights were very intense.
377	We are not at all opposed to children and families, it just was not their place walking around and through the casino.
378	The hotel is gorgeous .
378	The rooms with the views are worth it.
378	Everyone was extremely helpful.
379	great, wonderful my best experience, definitely i will back soon.
381	The suite was very clean and comfortable.
381	Once we notified the hotel staff that my husband's medication had to be refrigerated we were sent a complimentary refrigerator.
382	i enjoyed my stay until i check my account and the venetian had applied an amount of 60.38 to my credit card without informing me.
382	I call to ask what the charged was for, i was informed that it was a surcharge because wireless and the spa was available to me.
382	I didn't use the spa or the wireless service .
382	i should have been told this at check out.
382	I have stayed at the Venetian 7 times in the last 7 years and was never charged a surcharge.
383	This was my 4th visit to the Venetian and i travelled with my daughter.
383	I have always thought I was going somewhere special but this time I was very disappointed.
383	We arrived Thurs evening and the place was full of hen/stag parties who were loud(mainly women), rude and disrespectful.
383	The first night we had to move rooms owing to the loud music/shouting coming from next room.
383	Second evening we were woken at 4.45am by a drunken man hammering on the door thinking it was his room!
383	Third evening we were greeted by another drunk lying on the floor, pants round his ankles, showing us his backside!
383	Not really what I expected from a 5 star hotel who are charging a lot of money.
383	We did let reception know that we were disappointed and they waived the resort charge.
383	By Monday most of the party animals had left, things settled down and we actually enjoyed our last few days.
384	Our room was so nice and comfy and GRAND!
384	Would definitely recommend it to our friends and family!
384	One thing to look out for is the bill!
384	they tried to charge us for something we didn't even buy from the room or from room service!
384	But if you pick that out and ask them about it then they will remove it for you.
384	the Canal shoppes were just downstairs and you can be there all day if you wanted to as when we went it was really hot outside!
385	nice hotel，clean room ，staff，casino is fancy，fair price，definitely gonna go there again
386	Location and the ambiance was very good.
387	Excellent spot , beautiful suites lots of great restaurants and shopping would recommend this resort and would go back there.
387	Also great location on the strip!
389	The hotel atmosphere was amazing.
389	The staff was helpful and considerate.
389	I'd stay again in a heartbeat.
390	Wonderful we great food great lux was very good.
390	would have liked to come home as little richer machine only gave me 3of a kind what happens to all the 4of a kind?
390	My husband is disabled so the moving sidewalk not working was a bummer for him
391	A wonderful hotel with lots to do inside,fabulous for families.
391	Great restaurants and food courts.
391	Staff were fantastic and made it a fantastic holiday.
392	I really loved the room and the shopping mall attached to it.
392	we love the restaurants there too.
392	we stayed in a room with a view we love every thing in it
396	They cater to their clients and go out of their way to make you feel special
397	It was a gorgeous hotel with everything you can imagine.
397	Wherever you are walking, you feel like it is daytime and you feel fresh.
397	Artwork is stunning all around.
398	Casino right downstairs and is in the middle of everything so it is a pretty easy walk to most of the other casinos
399	The only problem was that they only wanted to give us 2 bath towels per day.
399	I finally had to tell them that I am paying for 4 people in this room, I want 4 clean bath towels per day, or else refund for 2 people per day for each of the 7 night.
399	Then I was finally able to get 4 bath towels.
400	Very convenience, comfortable and clean
402	Everything about the Venetian was fantastic.
402	The staff was friendly and helpful.
402	He restaurants were incredible.
402	The pools were beautiful.
402	The casino was lively and fun.
402	Not a single thing to complain about!
403	We stay in a Piazza Suite and where very pleased with both the cleanliness and service of the hotel.
404	Amazing and everything was Perfect!
404	Best place we've stayed.
404	Will return and stay again soon.
408	No words for how wonderful this stay was.
408	A perfect place for a honeymoon.
409	Had a great time.
409	Give yourself plenty of time to get from place to place.
409	The hotel is huge.
409	We were there 4 days and still did not see it all.
409	There also is NO buffet, lots of places to eat at food courts and Top shelf restaurants.
409	Also every vendor you pass will try and get you to buy something.
409	In a Class Hotel like this the management should calm it down.
411	They need to lower betting limits in casino for table games and its really expensive for everything!
412	it was the grandest hotel I ever stayed.
412	We enjoyed every second we were there.
413	Room and service were first class, recreation of Venice was excellent (having been three times to the real thing!
413	) and quite tastefully done.
413	Staff friendly and going that extra mile.
413	Location excellent in the middle of Strip within walking distance of other attractions.
413	Mall was also beautiful with indoor recreation of Venice.
413	Downside - everything in LV is designed to part the money from your wallet as efficiently as possible (15 minute gondola rides for $75 anyone?
414	This hotel made our experience traveling for first time to Vegas as a family very enjoyable.
414	Our two boys loved it.
414	A bit pricey but as we walked into many hotels on the strip we appreciated the Venetian even more due to its cleanliness and being very fancy and elegant.
414	We did not ask for much help from the staff but when we did they where very professional and willing to help.
414	From the reception area to the housekeepers who we saw in the morning that said "" hi "" and "" good morning "" to us every time.
414	Room was very spacious with more than enough room for four to do what we needed.
414	Next time we go to Las Vegas as a family or couple the Venetian will definitely be in our very short list of hotels to stay at.
415	This is a truly luxurious hotel with a grand setup.
415	The only thing to keep in mind is that it takes almost 10-15 minutes to reach your room from the lobby due to the size of this palatial hotel.
415	That  apart it has excellent location and very courteous staff always eager to help.
416	Very nice hotel, polite staff.
416	escalators weren't working on various days, down kaput on 1st day, up kaput on the following day.
416	rooms were very nice (bella suite),but bed was very firm & uncomfortable.
416	distance from parking to room seemed too long.
416	nice bathroom & huge tub were great after a long day.
416	we usually stay at the hard rock hotel (queen suites), but decided for a change on this trip.
416	hrh suites are much better, parking & suites very close to each other central to everything you want/need.
418	We loved staying at the Venetian.
418	Free room service breakfast included in our deal was a big hit for my husband.
418	My only complaint was that the bathroom wasn't super clean...
418	I hate finding hairs on the floor of hotel bathrooms...
421	Really liked the hotel although it is massive!
421	Super location & suite.
421	Customer Service was also great when needed.
421	As ai resort hotel it even has it's own shopping mall, tons of restaurants etc. the only down side for us was the Casino, thought it could do with an update!
422	It was like, dream come true experience.
422	I would strongly recommend this to all of friends , relatives.
422	etc. Nicely maintained with excellent amenities.
423	Interior and exterior are beautiful and well taken care of.
423	Our Suite was beautiful, large and comfortable...
423	we would have liked to have had a microwave and refrigerator.
423	The refrigerator in the room contained very expense items that we could purchase there wasn't any room for anything more.
423	We were very shocked that on the last two days of our 8 day stay was horrific!
423	The Hotel was over run with scantily dressed male and females.
423	There was a kid on a skateboard in the Casino.
423	The worst there was a very drunk almost asleep young lady who threw up at the table next to us in a Restaurant at the Hotel!
423	I don't know what the answer is for all of this, but it is upsetting that you pay for a 5 Star Hotel in Las Vegas and wind up feeling like you are at a Hotel on the Bowery...
423	we were very glad we were leaving in one day...
423	Don't worry we won't be back once is enough.
424	Our first trip to Las Vegas, but we visited several of the other large resort-type hotel complexes on the strip and considered that the Venetian was the best by far.
424	This was probably the smartest hotel room I've stayed in in the US.
424	Lots of good places to eat within the complex, too - just make sure you've got a map.
425	The hotel was absolutely beautiful!
425	If you are looking for a clean, beautiful hotel choose this one.
425	The artwork on the ceilings, the many fountains inside the hotel is worth the stay at this hotel.
426	Customer service very good and genuine .
426	Our teenage daughters loved it !
426	King size suites in the Venetian Tower stunning !
427	The room was spacious and very comfortable.
427	Unlike some hotels this one is not a tiny box.
427	Even the bathroom had lots of room to move.
427	All hotel staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful.
427	Between the hotel and the shops there were plenty of restaurant options.
427	I will definitely stay here again!
428	HOTEL SHOULD NOT CHARGE $25 ""RESORT FEE""
429	Very pleasant hotel suite - staff always appropriate and prompt to requests.
429	Unfortunately I would not return due to the smoke filled air in the public spaces.
429	Would chose a hotel without a casino next time (not a gambler or smoker).
429	Also note that the pool area does not have sun until afternoon and has limited lounge chairs in the sun area.
430	Will definitely recommend the Venetian to friends, faultless and memorable experience
431	Great room setting, very comfortable bed.
433	The hotel feels old, old pillows, old sheets (with holes in it), the amenities were good but they didnt give new ones (1 week lenght of stay and they didnt bring new soap and shampoo).
433	There is not a single hook to hang the towels, they called to my room to ask if they can do housekeeping even that the do not disturb sign was on the door.
434	Good but too big to stay Comfortable.
434	Confusing routes to guest room.
434	Attention to details are required.
435	The hotel was nice but in-room amenities, cokes, snacks, etc. were very expensive.
435	they also took up the entire refrigerator so you could not use for your own stuff.
435	The ice bucket has mold on the inside of the lid.
435	I left it tuned up so the cleaning crew would clean it but it never was cleaned.
435	My biggest annoyance was all of the additional charges.
435	I got my room through Expedia and they charged me for a for two queens vs.
435	And of course there was the Resort Fee.
435	By the time it was all said and done, I did not get the ""deal"" I thought I was which kind of set the mood for my vacation.
436	But it you wanted gö to your room you have To walk minumum 15 minutes.
436	Allah room to long to lobby ör other facilities
437	I stayed for 4 nights and i had not housekeeping for 2 nights.
437	Each time when i came back to my room around 8/9 pm , i called housekeeping to come to cleanup my room.
437	However, they left everything like before.
437	I just had bed makeup and new towel after calling.
438	We love to stay there and we want to go las vigas next year and stay same hotel .
439	The overal hotel experience was excellent, love the luxuries, cleanness, convenience of the hotel.
439	Very easy get around and enjoyed the relaxiation of stay.
440	great hotel with large suite rooms.
440	good selection of high quality food but a bit pricey for casual dining.
440	pool area good pleanty of sun loungers and waited drink service.
440	in general this hotel is spotless.
440	we went with our two children 8 & 9 and the pull out bed in a standard room was not wanting for space.
443	great hotel at the strip.
443	would recommend for first time travelers to Las Vegas.
444	The Venetian Las Vegas is probably the best hotel you can stay at The Strip.
444	Great amenities, perfect location, great restaurants and of course the Grand Canal Shoppes.
444	We enjoyed every moment of our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to spend quality time.
446	Took us about a day to get our bearings because the hotel along with the casino and shopping together is so large.
446	Will highly recommend to our friends and family.
447	Must have been a five star at one point and the prices for everything are like 5 star but the property looks aged.
447	Nothing special about the room.
447	Looks like they are trying to nickel and dime for everything.
447	Amenities were of the quality of 2 or maybe 3 star at the most.
447	Overall, if you can get this for less than 100 for a weekend night, it might be worth it.
447	I am not going back.
448	Felt updated and luxurious.
448	Hotel staff friendly and helpful.
449	It was wonderful to stay at Venitian.
449	World class hotel with all amenites.
449	Suite which i stayed was spacious and comfortable.
449	I will definetly recommand this hotel.
450	I stayed with my two friends for 3 nightes in double queen bed room.
450	very elegante and comfortble , clean rooms, the staff was very helpfull.
451	I've made numerous trips to Vegas.
451	I've stayed at nearly every hotel there.
451	I was even married in the penthouse suite of the famous one with the fountain.
451	This hotel, by far, is my favorite.
451	The housekeeping staff were impeccable.
451	The staff in General were amazing, well trained, well versed and helpful.
451	I doubt I'll stay at any other hotel again.
453	The Venetian was a beautiful hotel.
453	It was somewhat confusing to get around especially the shops.
453	The outdoor passageways were great and made it easy to follow.
453	We loved the gondola ride.
453	I wished when we checked in the person would have explained all the coupons and how things worked since we had never had been to Vegas before, we probably could have saved ourselves money.
453	We liked having the extra sitting room our suite so that we could sit around and relax before going out again or at the end of a long day.
453	The housekeeping staff was great and were quick to clean the room when you left.
453	We ate dinner in the hotel 4 days and the food was great.
453	The Lux on the casino floor was a great quick meal, but we enjoyed some of the finer dining too.
453	Went to B/B and the waiter was great explaining the menu especially with our teenage girls.
454	Hotel room was very nice.
454	Nice view, with three TVs including the one in the bathroom :)) my kids just loved the room.
455	Unreal hotel, beautiful rooms, service staffis top notch
456	Only bad experience was that rooms where made late.
457	We visited with friends for a friendly pre-holiday celebration.
457	We had a great time.
458	From the moment I checked-in to the time I left my expectations of the hotel's facilities and staff were exceeded.
458	I cannot recommend this hotel more highly for a truly luxurious Las Vegas experience.
459	We had a wonderful time.
459	Love the hotel and service was great
460	Very good restaurants and shopping.
460	Beautiful areas for pictures.
460	Fun for whole family
461	Great hotel next to everything has a walgreens and allot of different activites to ofer for everyone great food in all price ranges best hotel
462	Nice place to stay.
462	Well located, adjacent to Grand Canal Shoppes, close to Fashion Show Mall for those who like shopping.
462	Many restaurants available nearby.
462	Nothing wrong to tell about the hotel except that there was a small charge (8$) added on the final invoice supposedly related to the minibar, which we hadn't touched at all.
462	The gentlemen at the desk readily agreed to remove it on check out.
462	Back at home, when I checked my credit card statement, there was an 11 $ charge added.
462	Not much compared to the overall invoice but it still leaves the impression of being robbed...
464	Hotel staff was always ""busy"" other than with face to face customers.
464	They seemed to be in hurry going places or on their phones not acknowledging the customers in line.
464	Check in took forever and we arrived at 6pm.
464	The check in female seemed to be new or just not know what she was doing, checked us into the wrong type of room, and we had to move at 9pm at night.
464	Pools not clean at all, tons of leaves and dirt all over the top and bottom of pools and hot tubs, messy towel area not clean at all.
464	Pool hours vary day to day, no specific times listed at all, and very limited, not open past 9pm.
464	It does not matter where you eat on site, they all offer the same food, they are all prepared the same way with the same ingredients/suppliers.
464	The bonus was that there is a Walgreens attached to the hotel so we could purchase less expensive fresh water and foods.
464	Do not drink the sink water from anywhere in Vegas or Nevada I guess it is all recycled water and can make you extremely sick.
464	It's Vegas just remember you will not be spending much time in your hotel room, my recommendation is to save your money for fun activities and stay at a cheaper hotel.
464	Too much going on at this one.
465	Comfortable and spacious room.
465	View of the Mirage volcano show from the room.
465	Close to good shopping and great restaurants.
465	Overall an awesome vacation.
467	One of our stops loved your hotel & resort.
468	Wonderfull suites, great place to gambling, near everything
469	The Venetian is located in a great spot on the Strip.
469	Yes it is the north end or the strip, but close to Monorail, and most Hotels are in walking distance.
469	St. Marks square in the complex is very nice as are the shops.
469	I went for a professional shave, very relaxing.
469	I had the breakfast buffet at the hotel, not much to write home about.
469	A plus is that I did not have to walk to long in the casino before I reached the elevators.
469	The room was clean and big, Luxury suite, the only draw back was the WIFI, the signal was week at best, cut out many times.
469	The IT person tried to fix the situation but to no avail.
469	I did receive a refund on the resort fee.
470	When we first got to the Venetian, the atmosphere just was astounding.
470	The room was super amazing and the bed was comfortable.
470	The grand luxe cafe was perfect place to eat any meal.
470	Big portions and reasonably price.
470	Next time we go back to Vegas, we are either staying at the Venetian or Caesars Palace (only because we want to stay there one time).
471	Big suites with comfortable beds, furniture, two flat screen TVs plus another TV in the bathroom for those who like to stay in the bath and watch TV and many other great stuff.
471	Service was great - extra pillows, blankets came within minutes of requesting.
471	Our kids had fun playing with the remote controlled drapery & shades.
471	Wi-Fi didn't work well in the room- may be too many people using it.
471	If you want to use the high-speed internet connection, you have to pay a high price!
471	Also, don't touch any of the snacks or water bottles provided-they are on a sensor and you will be charged.
472	This is an amazing hotel, romm was super clean and comfy.
472	Well worth the price.
473	Liked the Burbon Room.
473	That said, know its Vegas but hated having to change cloths three times a day due to smoke.
473	Need more smoke free areas.
475	Its a great hotel with shopping mall.
475	but the pool is little to small and close at 6pm
477	Great giant hotel with large casino, Gondula ride, Restaurant and lots more.
477	Located in the strip and close to many other attraction.
478	Everyone was helpful and pleasant.
479	The hotel, venezia tower, looks good.
479	Room is big and clean.
479	But it is very complicated to approache to the room from the hotel lobby.
479	We had to transfer the elevator twice to move to the Venzia tower.
479	It takes around 15 min to get to the room.
479	It was a tiring job.
479	The hotel staffs were rude and unprofessional.
479	Concierge was not ready to answer in a proper way.
479	They seemed to guess the answer for my questions.
479	We were in trouble after following their direction.
479	I complained to the manager but she jsut hung up my call while I'm talking.
479	What a rude staff.
479	In the hall way, I tried to say hello to hotel staff, but they just turn their face or ignore my greetings.
479	It was a frustrating and nasty expereince to be ignored in the resort by the hotel staff.
479	They have to learn to say hello or Good Morning to guest.
479	My trip to Las Vegas with my family was ruined by a terrible treatment by Venetian.
479	It was so big that they just treat guests as a part of it or as their daily routine.
479	The restaurants in the hotel are so expensive but the quality was unbelievably terrible.
479	I would not recommend the Venetian.
479	Also, the shared transportation, Bell Train, was terrible too.
479	When I got back to the airport, the bus was late 20min.
479	The bus driver just said ""I am 10 min ahead.
479	Don't yelling me.
479	I don't know why the bus didn't come at 12pm.
479	"" It was so disappointing too.
479	Expedia, please control the quality of every service you provide.
480	For my second time in Vegas and returning to the Venetian, I would of expected some preferential treatment.
480	Especially since I am an elite platinum IHG member.
480	I asked for the VIP lounge they said no!
480	All I got was free internet, and this was already included in the 29 dollars per day resort fees you have to pay!
480	Its all about the Money!
480	Bet you 100 bucks this does not get posted!
480	Mike Ilantzis IHG Platinum Member ( means Nothing!
481	We loved our stay.
481	We were upgraded due to a convention and everything was wonderful.
481	Everything from our room to the restaurants and all the facilities available.
481	Will definitely stay there again.
482	They were able to accommodate our adjoining room request, but we were put in the Venezia Tower (added 5 minute walk) from everything to make it happen.
482	Palazzo looked much nicer.
482	I would stay there next time instead.
483	I paid an upgrade fee for a strip view room.
483	It was not a strip view - well perhaps if you looked out the corner of the window behind some buildings you might have got a glimpse of part of the strip.
483	When I called to complain, instead of trying to help me they kept repeating that on their records it was a strip view room.
483	I explained as I looked out the window that it was not.
483	My only option was to check out of that room and into another room with no opportunity to see if the other room was better, worse or the same.
483	I didn't trust their opinion as to what a strip view room was.
483	After a few minutes of some lady telling me my non-strip view room had a strip view, I finally gave up ad sucked up my wasted extra fee - I didn't want to spend my whole vacation on the phone with the front desk.
483	I'm sure they were counting on that.
483	NO interest in making sure I was happy with the resolution to my problem.
483	Then on check out 11:00 am.
483	Oh and forget about late check out.
483	They deny it so often all you get is a recording telling you its not available.
484	My only complaint was the a/c.
484	Me and my girlfriend woke up with very dry mouths due to the a/c.
484	It would be nice if they added a humidifier, or had one available upon request.
485	the location of this hotel is perfect, in the middle of strip.
485	walking distance to almost all of good performance on the strip.
486	It was awesome including the staff,security,rooms and casino
487	Surprisingly good for a toddler.
487	Staff were generally good.
487	Not sure it is the best casino if that is your thing.
487	Also, I don't recommend the breakfast option.
487	Do yourself a favor and get a Mimosa and a muffin from somewhere else.
489	The hotel was great!
489	I never wondered about is cleanlinessat all.
489	The staff always spoke first and they never seemed in the way.
489	The hotel is situated right in the middle of the strip also which was convenient to me.
489	The only thing I would say is that the room seemed so far away after a long day of sightseeing.
489	I would stay again.
489	Use the monorail system which is located right behind the Harrah's property.
490	This was a business trip and usually I don't use casinos but we were meeting associates for dinner nearby.
490	This is an all suite hotel so all of the rooms are good.
490	Like most properties on the strip now days they charge a resort fee, whether you can use the pool or other amenities or not.
490	Still the hotel and the room was very nice and the price was reasonable for the quality.
491	TRULY A PLEASURABLE STAY.
491	Scenery was great and the rooms were large enough to accommodate any small gathering or a private part.
491	We especially like the condiments that were in the room.
491	We would recommend this great hotel to any one who has not had the pleasure of being pampered...
492	I've stayed at several hotels on the strip and this is the best.
492	The staff at reception were very good , arranging a late checkout for all our rooms.
492	The hotel rooms are exceptional , as you would expect from this level of hotel.
492	Location on the strip is good and you also have the shopping arcade and restaurants on site.
493	Rooms are large and clean.
493	Lots of stuff for everyone to do.
494	Apart from a problem with the in suite dining we had it was pretty much what we wished for...
494	Walking distance from everything and the staff were great!
495	The suites are fantastic.
495	The hotel is located in a perfect place.
495	The restaurants are great.
497	The Venetian is definitely my favorite Hotel in Las Vegas!
497	The place was amazing!
497	Can't wait to do it Again!
498	I stayed April 17, 2015 - April 19, 2017.
498	The two main issues I was not happy with:Our bathroom sink made noises.
498	It appears that it had some type of back pressure.
498	Could not tell you how it got fixed because there was no follow-up with us.
498	The concierge service almost ruined my morning.
498	I was in line to ask about printing out my boarding pass, when my turn came up a tall dark hair gentlemen looked at me and shouted ""sir, there is a line here"".
498	Needless to say I was embarrassed to be singled out for braking the line when I did not!
498	I walked away from the line embarrassed.
500	Great hotel and casino with several venues.
500	Food was great at the Lux Cafe too.
501	It was a great place to come back to after a long day on the stip
503	By far the best hotel/resort in the whole of Las Vegas, and also the best I have ever stayed in in my whole life.
503	Service was second to none, and the cleanest suites and highest quality of food I have experienced at any hotel resort.
505	Not a pleasant experience.
505	We called the Venetian hotel two days before arrival trying to get a high floor room at the Venetian tower.
505	A lady told us we were assigned a 12th floor room at the Venezia tower.
505	We called again a few hours later and talked to a guy named Brandon.
505	He said we can stay at any tower because the hotel has a lot of rooms.
505	Upon check in, Daniel was the one who helped us.
505	After numerous effort and time trying to convince my tired wife for additional upgrade, Daniel finally told us he tried his best and gave us a 12th floor room at the Venezia tower.
505	Not a very good experience considering us spending almost $400 a night including all those resort fees and taxes.
505	We got this feeling from the first lady that we talked to over the phone that she can do better if we had not booked through a third party.
507	My stay at the Venetian was beyond amazing!
507	Great room, very clean and big.
507	Super comfortable and at a great price.
510	The hotel is fine, better than most on the strip.
512	Great experience from check in to check out!
513	Room was top notch, casino large and bright, restaurants at every corner!
513	One of the top 3-4 resorts in Vegas.
515	Was told I should upgrade to Pallazo for no extra cost when I got there to see the fireworks for new years better.
516	Loved my stay at this hotel!
516	The rooms are huge.
516	Staff friendly, good location.
518	Came as first timers .
518	Had chance to visit other hotels, but this one the best.
521	Hotel is very impressive and exceeded our expectations in terms of luxury and comfort.
521	The hotel complex is massive and navigation from one part to another somewhat complicated, but there are always staff on hand to point you in the right direction.
521	We enjoyed sampling the variety of facilities available which are first rate and made extensive use of the great selection of 'Vegas priced' restaurants on site.
521	Main area for improvement would be the arrival/ check-in process.
521	We drove to the hotel in a rental car and arrived at a busy time.
521	Directions were very unclear and it was virtually impossible to find a place to stop and unload the car at the main entrance.
521	Having been misdirected by staff a couple of times we eventually gave up and headed for the self-parking.
521	However, this meant that we were faced with a half-mile trek with suitcases to get to the registration area in the lobby.
521	We'd booked two rooms and were able to get adjacent rooms which were upgraded to 'Strip view' which was well worth the small extra charge.
521	The Venezia tower gives spectacular views and directly overlooks the Mirage night-time fountain display which was fun to watch.
521	Overall a very enjoyable and memorable stay.
523	Hotel was in a good location and heaps of restaurants and shopping in the vicinity.
523	Room was spacious but a little dated.
523	Hotel staff were not particularly helpful.
523	We came for our honeymoon and no effort was made to acknowledge the reason for our stay despite advising the hotel during reservation.
525	My wife and I wanted something special for our Honeymoon.
525	The Venetian was everything plus more.
525	The hotel was beautiful ( Felt I was in Venice)...
525	Our room was perfect, the staff was friendly and the guests that  were staying at the hotel was a class act.
525	A person could stay the week at the hotel for a week and never leave...
525	The Venitian is not a hotel, but an experience that I will always cherish.
526	Room was quite large w/ a separate sitting area.
526	Great view of the pool.
526	Numerous restaurants and shops just downstairs.
526	Would definitely stay here again.
527	Beautifully appointed and maintained...
527	A total Class Act!
528	This hotel is stunning and actually makes you feel like you are in Venice.
528	The stunning lobby, Grand Canal Shoppes, and of course ""St.
528	Mark's Square"" are all jaw dropping beautiful.
528	The suites are very spacious and well appointed.
528	Many, many, fabulous restaurants to choose from -- we ate at B & B (best meal of our stay), Otto (fantastic pizza!
528	), Public House, and Burgers and Beer (best burgers!
528	), and Delmonico (try the Chateaubriand and banana cream pie!
528	).  Staff was wonderful.
528	5 Star all the way.
529	Enjoyed our stay and will return.
529	The hotel layout is a little confusing and the maps provided need to be enlarged and simplifies.
531	Hotel was lovely and the rooms were excellent very spacious.
531	Only complaint was that no umberellas/parasol were provided by the pool.
532	Experience at this hotel was good.
532	Staff was friendly and helpful.
533	The Venetian is by far the nicest hotel I have stayed at in Las Vegas.
533	Spacious and clean rooms.
533	My only complaint is that the pools close at 8pm which is far too early in my opinion.
535	Superb service, room, food, spa and personnel.
535	You get what you pay for.
535	Congratulations on a job well done!
536	Great hotel but big and spread out.
536	Stay in main tower.
536	We stayed in Venezia and you end up doing a lot of walking
537	That didn't take debit and credit combine credit card and bask full cash deposits.
537	Thrash was still left from previous stay in the room.
537	They charge for water in the room.
537	Didn't have air dryer in the room.
537	The reservation for check out was i for 1 o'clock possibly 2 o'clock but the says that I should check out at 11 AM the next day they made walk into the room without knocking on the door at the 11 o'clock.
537	It's not a friendly hotel.
537	For Any accommodation by The hotel require to have a fight for it.
537	Don't forget when you check out the hotel charge you additional $25.
537	+ tax For services not given which was not to mention at the time of reservation on the prepaid room accommodation.
538	We received top notch customer service from the moment we checked in.
538	The staff at the counter, the concierge, the housekeeping staff, Grazie Desk staff and the Casino floor...
538	all were super helpful and friendly.
538	The restaurants are wonderful!
538	I don't have one thing to complain about.
538	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
539	We were upgraded to a very large suite for just a small fee.
540	Generally pleased with the experience.
540	It was  nice staying so close to canal
541	It's one of the best hotels on the strip.
541	Right in the middle of everywhere.
541	Was in the Bella queen suite and loved it!
541	Spacious and beautiful room and bath room.
541	Was clubbing at XS so it was so convenient, right beside!
541	If you don't want to be disturbed by (nice and courteous) cleaning ladies at 8am, please hang the ""don't disturb"" sign!
541	There's also a walgreens right below, for emergencies.
542	the view could have been better.
544	We had a super time!
544	So much to do and see!
544	Valet parking was free and EASY!
544	Only complaint is that there needs to be more shaded areas at the pool.
544	It is extremely hot and if you don't pay for pricey cabanas you really can't sit ""pool side"" for very long.
544	Other than that it was a GREAT stay!
546	The hotel stay was very good.
546	Just like everywhere in LV, the whole place smells like smoke, booze and drugs, but they had no control over that.
546	I still think the Venetian was the cleanest hotel that I walked into on the Strip.
547	Some people lost staff during living in this hotel.
549	We stayed in the venzia part of hotel and it was confusing and very long walk to our rooms from anywhere else
550	The place is very clean, beautiful and is Huge...
550	Easy to get lost in.
550	Easy 5 star hotel but the Plazzao the Venetian's sister hotel is better!
550	I have stayed at both.
550	Book either as they are well worth it but my next stay will be at the Plazzao Hotel & Casino
552	It was a very good time.
552	The Venetian had rooms that blow you away upon arrival.
553	Our stay was absolutely amazing!
553	The staff is friendly and courteous and the hotel is top notch.
553	The room was beyond my expectations!
554	Everything about this hotel is first rate.
554	We went with high expectations and were not disappointed.
554	The word that best describes The Venetian is CLASS.
554	The place makes you feel special and the sheer opulence of the interior is something we'll never forget.
554	The shops were not the sort of shops we could afford, BUT the pleasure in walking around them was wonderful.
554	The in house restaurants were a little pricey but the coffee shops were reasonably priced and the food beautifully presented.
554	All in all The Venetian is to be highly recommended and could we afford to go back to Las Vegas then we would definitely stay there again.
555	The comping system is very poor and needs a major overhaul.
555	You can never review your points, they never seem to give back anything, just take.
555	Compared to other hotels I have recently stayed, I will not be returning anytime soon.
556	This is my second visit in less than a year.
556	This time I had more time to explore the hotel.
556	I recommended that my friends come with me, and they had the best time ever.
556	She utilized Prestige, and was more than happy.
556	The restuarants are superb, I cannot say enough about the shops.
556	Earth Wind and Fire concert was tops.
557	The customer service was amazing.
557	They even gave us a free upgrade to a suite!
557	Everyone deserves a raise.
559	Room was nice, staff great, crazy long walk just to get to the strip.
559	Moving sidewalks were out of order as well...
559	I bet it's nice in the high season though!
560	never disappointed in this hotel, big room and huge lobby.
561	Remi was amazing the most wonderful person to deal with and the stay was amazingSecond time there will return again.
562	Great Hotel, great location.
564	Loved every minute in Vegas, so many things to do.
565	We stayed in the Venezia tower.
565	The room/suite was very spaciouse and beautiful .
565	the bathroom was luxturious .
565	The service was excellent .
565	And to top it off , the Bouchon restourant is located right there in the tower.
565	We had a great time.
566	we had a wonderful time at the Venetian, everything we booked and expected.
566	Staff lovely, suite we had was gorgeous coudn't fault it would definately stay there again.
566	Loved Las Vegas Venetian close to most other hotels on the strip, if your looking for reasonable breekie in Ventian go to the I LOVE BURGERS nice food cooked well.
568	The hotel is simply beautiful, the front desk personnel very attentive and prompt service
569	This was my second stay in the Venetian and I don't understand  why I haven't stay in this hotel before.
569	Very clean, very comfortable, and very helpful and compassionate staff.
570	it was very good, will stay there again.
571	I think that the Venetian experience was definitely an experience.
571	It was 5 star in appearance but to me it was overpriced and not as comfortable as I expected, but for those who go to Vegas with expectations of Casinos and Entertainment it is appropriate.
572	Everything about our stay was perfect with the exception of a few snobby people who worked there, but in a hotel this big you have to expect it.
572	My husband and I didn't bring our child (who is one) & there were few children there.
572	I recommend this hotel to more couples and singles than ""families"".
572	This hotel is also a little more expensive than the other hotels, so if your coming be prepared to spend your $ ;)
573	We enjoyed our 2 nights at the hotel.
573	The only negative thing we incurred was the Spa experience.
573	It took 3 contact points to get us into our appointment which made us late and they did not extend the massage time.
573	The hotel provided everything - the Japanese/Brazilian/Peruvian restaurant (can't remember the name) was excellent.
573	The food was over-the-top.
573	We will stay again.
575	Be aware of their $23 per night room rate upcharge at checkout.
577	Hotel is awesome and service is way better than expectations.
577	If you are visiting Vegas then this alone hotel can your memories unforgettable.
577	Gandola rides(Inside), casino, food, Canal shops area, Tintoretto Bakery, etc. The experience cannot be described in words, one has to stay and feel it.
579	Very large and sometimes confusing to navigate.
580	A stylish hotel with lots to see and do, the rooms are nice and clean but a bit dated.
580	One of the most Northern hotels on the strip, which could mean a lot of walking.
581	Great experience, room was very nice.
581	Not a big deal but if you are heading to the airport during low traffic tell cab driver to take local route not the highway(15 I believe).
581	Our driver took highway and it cost us $10-$15 more than it should have.
582	An impressive hotel on the strip, walking distance from all attractions.
583	Fast check in & out staff is very friendly.
583	A great hotel for business travel.
584	It was a good experience because was something new for us, the only thing was the extremely warm weather
585	No hitches with booking or accommodation, the ""Resort Fee"" was certainly annoying and most definitely took away from the experience.
585	Hotel kept very clean, staff professional and very helpful.
586	The hotel room had excellent decor, the food in the hotel was excellent and the fitness center was more than acceptable.
586	My wife enjoyed the spa as well.
587	Our room was in the Venezia tower, which was very far away from the convention center.
587	Last time we stayed at the other tower.
587	The decor was outdated and looked worn in our room.
587	The toiletries were not very nice, smelled terrible .
588	The housekeeping is cery bad
591	Very nice place to stay if you enjoy being pampered.
591	The shops, the casino, everything is nice, there is a relaxing mood.
591	The room has a kind of a romantic mood, You can shop around and have dinner without dealing with your credit card or money, the hotel put it on the note directly.
591	Only little things are annoying like no Blu Ray player in a $250 room a night, the expensive Internet connection and the even more expensive beverage.
594	the Hotel and resort was amazing...
594	Good Food, clean place a real 5 star resort.
597	Conveniently located by a Walgreens.
597	Pool is on the smaller side and no bells and whistle...
598	Best hotel in Vegas!
598	Restaurants, bars and casino are second to none.
599	We stayed here last year and returned as the rooms are immaculate, very spacious which suits our family of 4, family friendly and well located.
599	Service was good and room always clean.
599	Hotel is very busy, particularly this time of year so service felt a little less personable, however still of a high standard.
599	The hotel offers plenty to do, with shops, eateries, shows, Madam Tussauds, and much more.
599	On New Year's Eve our room offered a fantastic view of the fireworks and all that was happening on the strip.
599	We had another wonderful stay at this hotel and will definitely return on our next trip to Vegas!
600	Best hotel I have stayed in in Vegas, and have tried quite a few!
601	Had a great time the rooms are all suites and they have pretty much all options of eating for all
602	The rooms well very nice and comfortable.
602	We were fortunate to have a newly remodeled room.
602	Overall a good stay.
602	The customer service was excellent - no issue to big or small.
603	Planned my stay last minute.
603	Loved everything about my room except the bathroom had a bit of a stench.
603	The view was lovely.
603	Enjoyed Tao Beach and the pools.
603	The casino wasn't as smoky and the tables were average price.
603	It's a great location with plenty of things to do.
604	This hotel complex has everything one needs.
604	We have eaten at least 6 of the on-site restaurants and had never been disappointed.
604	It is also located at the heart of the strip.
604	The only thing I didn't like was the tobacco smoke.
604	Even though we were supposed to be in a non-smoking room, our luggage smelled like tobacco after we opened it back home and both my wife and I had a lot of runny nose when we were in the room.
604	The living room light also didn't work in one of the two rooms we stayed at.
605	The hotel is absolutely beautiful!
605	I had a wonderful time there.
605	Delicious restaraunts, shopping and a beautiful room to relax in!
606	Great location and room but lacks in service standards.
606	In room food delivery usually takes 45+ minutes on non-peak days.
606	One of the days we had to wait an hour and fifteen minutes to have the cutlery picked up.
606	Staff is generally good at their job but not responsive to the customers needs.
606	Could be better overall in customer experience.
607	Very nice, it had all we needed and more.
607	Great fitness facilities too.
608	Always entertaining,great restaurants, pools, shops.
608	Never have to leave the hotel.
608	Like being in Venice
609	Room was very nice, but food in the 'Public House' was high price and not good.
609	I have had 'free' breakfasts at variuo hotels that were superior.
610	Only complaint is the lighting in the bathroom isn't very bright - especially for putting make-up on.
610	Otherwise, the suites are huge, very clean and upscale.
610	If you like muffins, the Grand Lux Cafe in the hotel has the BEST cranberry muffins!
610	Lots to see and do in the hotel - you can spend hours going through it!
610	Been to many hotels in Vegas, keep coming back to the Venetian - it's my favorite!
611	Easy check in and check out.
611	Many dining option and family friendly.
612	It is my favorite hotel in Vegas.
612	This is the second time I stay.
612	It is as elegant and comfortable as I remembered.
612	Love the Da Vinci exhibition on the first floor.
613	Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Vegas!
613	Amazing is all I can say.
615	Check in was easy, and the room was spacious and nicely decorated.
615	We asked for a room with a view, and that's what we got.
615	We were on a week-long roadtrip, and this was one of 6 hotels we stayed in, and it was the most disappointing.
615	Virtually every hotel nowadays provides a hairdryer in the bathroom, an in-room coffee maker, and a refrigerator.
615	There was a refrigerator in the room, but it was stocked with beverages that are pressure activated to automatically charge the room for any beverage lifted off the shelf.
615	especially since there was no sign on the refrigerator warning you about this.
615	The porter did tell us about it, and it is in the notebook of services in the room, but who reads that from cover to cover?
615	I expect to pay top dollar for drinks from an in-room minibar, but the pressure-sensitive automatic charging seems tacky and cheap.
615	There are three televisions in the room, imcluding one in the bathroom, but I'd rather have a hairdryer in the bathroom or a coffee pot in the room and one less t.v.
616	Everything was nice in the hotel environment.
616	The only thing to be complained about is the automatic charge of Refrigerator items if you touch or remove any one even just a curious check up.
617	The room had all the amenities with 2 extra tv's, stocked refrigerator, living room with sofa, small desk, printer/fax machine, small snack tray of items and remote control shades / blinds.
617	All the items in the refrigerator and snack tray are charged against your room and are over priced.
617	Also, the refrigerator was not for personal use.
617	You will be hit with additional charges called ""resort fees"" at check out.
617	We had to call the front desk at 8 p.m. because they had not cleaned our room.
617	When we returned from our 9 p.m. show, they just made the bed, laid out fresh linen and did not empty the trash or vaccum.
617	The next day, I showered in the morning and after lunch when we returned our room had been service to find the same shower mat still wet laid over the tub and one of the robes that was dirty and we had placed in the tub with all the other dirty linen, had been hung over the hook in the bathroom.
617	If your wife would like to have an extra towel to dry her hair or you like taking two showers a day, you will have to request additional linen.
617	On another day we got wash clothes in place of hand towels.
617	I gotta say, for the price you pay, I expected a lot better service and less price gouging.
617	Be aware they will nickel and dime you anyway they can.
617	The food and service in the various restaurants was outstanding.
617	The various shops and attractions were amazing.
617	The casino was clean and the layout was nicely done.
617	I checked ""yes"", I would recommend this hotel but be alert.
619	Loved it But only one thing I reserved a room with a king sixe bed and ir was not available at the time we checked in and had to take a doble bed room.
620	Very good experience overall.
620	The only thing bothering me a lot is the walking distance from my room (in Venezia Tower) to parking garage is too long.
621	Although we had a bit of trouble getting the right room at the start(non-smoking) , the rest of our stay was excellent.
621	Upgraded to a room with a terrace for our troubles, bonus.
621	Rooms are comfy, bathrooms are supreme.
621	Room service was top notch .
621	Hotel is grand, bright, clean, and smells good, even with the smoke.
621	Close to all amenities.
621	Would stay again for sure.
621	From what we saw, nicest hotel on the strip.
622	Huge room with sunken living room area.
622	Even the bathroom had a TV!
622	The hotel is stunning and the service impeccable.
622	Our view of the mountains was spectacular.
623	Everything was great and it gave us the las Vegas experience we were looking for.
624	This place has everything you need!
625	This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel since 5/2014.
625	Having stayed at many different Vegas hotels in past years, I can say that this one is by far the most fun and convenient PLUS it has an incredible gym!
625	You really don't need to leave the hotel for anything unless, you want to check out the strip.
625	You'll find many restaurants to choose from and several food courts.
625	The food is excellent and the service is awesome!
625	A Walgreens is located next door and I would suggest stopping there to stock up on bottled water and snacks.
625	Drinks are pricey so, you may want to grab a bottle of wine or two.
625	They have several pools but, they are very busy on Fridays and Saturdays so, grab a chair early.
625	The pool's bar serves great food and the service is fast.
625	They also have the best bartender!
625	I found the staff throughout the hotel to be very pleasant and accommodating from check in to check out & I was most impressed by the fact that many remembered me by name.
625	You will not be disappointed if you choose the Venetian!
625	Be sure to see ROCK OF AGES and visit the BOURBON ROOM!
626	Decided to treat ourselves - and even though we booked the cheapest room, (mid-week rates are lower too) - we weren't disappointed!
626	Huge bathroom, comfortable bed and a lounge area that we didn't have time to use.
626	It was made up perfectly each day.
626	Services available inside the hotel were great as well, including restaurants/cafes, shopping, bars, tour/event booking.
626	We saw Rock of Ages which was fun!
626	Walking distance to all the other main hotels/casinos on the strip too, so excellent location.
627	Beautiful resort with very large landscaped Lpool area.
627	Suites are spacious and comfortable.
627	There were issues with elevetor maintenance as people got stuck.
627	Overall tough, this hotel is very nice and well situated.
628	Everythings works as it supposed to.
629	Right when we got there we didn't have to wait in line.
629	Service the whole time was unbelievable.
629	Rooms were very clean and first class the whole way...
630	Unfortunately we were in the older Wong this time--can tell some updating needed to be done.
630	Still a gorgeous hotel and would love to go back again!
631	Great hotel, great mall with restaurants , shops etc
632	Can not fault this hotel, absolutely fantastic in every way.
633	Clean hotel with a lot going on.
633	Check in lines were long.
634	The service was great and the food was awesome.
634	Great place for a girls trip.
635	It's just that everything a la carte.
635	No coffee pot in the rooms, means you have to order room service for coffee.
635	There is a Fridge in the room but U can't use it cuz it is jammed full of their overpriced stuff that is pressure sensitive.
635	Nothing of yours will fit & if u move their stuff U get charged.
635	I guess this is the future of hotels.
636	The hotel was wonderful.
636	We did have a problem with bed pillows and when addressed this was taken care of immediatly.
636	Some of the restaurants were delightful, some, not so much.
636	The casino staff were not amenable to answering questions, we seemed to be considered only a problem for them.
637	One of the best hotels on the strip.
637	Exuberance only rivaled by Bellagio and Wynn.
637	Pools are the only area lacking.
637	Casino and poker room are great.
637	Rooms are huge and insanely clean.
639	The hotel itself is nice- clean, big rooms and comfortable bed.
639	My biggest issue is the staff- particularly the front desk who answered my phone call (unfortunately I didn't her name).
639	A night earlier I asked if the bottled water was complimentary and the operator said yes.
639	When I was ready to check out I was charged for the bottled water.
639	When I questioned this the front desk person gave me an attitude and said in a condescending manner ""there is nothing complimentary in your suite.
639	"" Management- train your staff!
640	Really nice hotel with great rooms.
640	The only thing that let it down was the slightly disappointing/confused room maids who didnt seem to understand when you asked them not to enter the room.
640	Lots of great food and shopping options within the hotel to keep you busy!
641	Amazing hotel , everything about it is perfect.
641	The pools are amazing!
641	The rooms are so nice.
641	Can't wait to go back!
643	We came here for my sweetie's 30th birthday and stayed for a week.
643	Stayed at the Luxury Suite and it was SO NICE!
643	The room was cleaned every day, they even brought up a mini-fridge so we can keep cold drinks in since we didn't want to use the mini bar :) Rooms were cleaned every day and we found all the staff very friendly and helpful.
643	No coffee machine BUT there is many places close by that offer Tea / Coffee so that's better than nothing!
644	My husband and I had an amazing time staying at the venetian it literaly was italy in vegas the best of both worlds.
644	We have no complaints as far as staff, they were very helpful and when there was an issue they did so much to ocrrect it and make it all better
645	It was quite and clean and awesome price for the room.
646	food to your room over expensive and just horrible .
647	WONDERFUL - best accomodation we ever had.
647	Recommend it without any warnings to future guests.
648	The check in host was not accommodating and she seemed rude and uninterested.
648	After check in-the rest of the experience was only positive.
649	Did not leave much only to go golfing.
649	Loved it Casinos were great they paid off well.
649	I won than lost than still won a few hundred
651	Coulda used more towels/toilet paper.
651	Probably more our fault than theirs.
652	wifi signal was weak in rooms, but was freebathroom was too darktv remote did not workrooms were very nicegrand lux restaurant was very goodsports book was excellent
653	I expected better service than Wynne, Caesars Palace.
653	But the service of staffs & room of Venetian are inferior to the ones at Wynne, Caesers.
654	I really loved the layout of our guest suite room.
655	Although the supply of towels/facecloths, etc. was uneven (you never knew what you were going to get), the room was cleaned very well every day.
655	I do wish they supplied a coffee maker and more glasses other than the two provided in the bathroom and two wine glasses.
655	Other than that, the staff was very helpful and very pleasant to deal with.
655	After day visits to some of the other hotels on the strip, the Venetian really stood out as a very well maintained, clean hotel with plenty of great restaurants to choose from.
655	The pool area was beautiful as well, surrounded by well maintained gardens.
656	Overall the experience was positive, what I did not like was the $25 mandatory resort fees that I was told about at check in.
656	Had I known about this I would have booked another hotel.
657	Great experience with family and friends.
657	The rooms are beautiful and spacious
659	Wonderful, comfortable stay in fairly luxurious hotel, a bit more upmarket than we would normally chose but got a great deal we could not refuse.
659	The Venetian is a large hotel, some 3500 rooms, so be prepared for a lot of walking between areas of the hotel before you even step out onto the Strip!
659	To be perfectly honest you really don't ever need to leave the hotel complex, everything you could ever need/ wish for is available there from fancy restaurants to fast food outlets, plenty of upmarket shopping also, a couple of theatre/show venues, a large outdoor area with 3, maybe 4 swimming pools with loads of sunbathing facilities and of course the casino.
659	We stayed 7 nights and to be perfectly honest that was maybe too long but we managed to get away from it all by hiring a car for a couple of days and explored a bit more of Vegas other than the Strip.
660	Nice and luxury hotelGreat canal shopping mallNext to Walgreens
661	had an overall experience hotel was clean and staff friendly
663	we had a great time - very enjoyable
664	Everything was ok, the room was nice.
664	But when checking out, we complained a serious issue bur the employee did not seem to be bothered much, which made us feel unappreciated.
667	Unbelievable suite for so little money.
667	Very comfortable bed, fantastic bathroom.
668	Only complaint/concern was location of room.
668	I am partially disabled and had to walk almost 1/2 mile to casino and even further to Palazzo.
668	I know they offer motorized carts, but this is not convenient in restaurants and playing tables in casino.
668	Next time will rqst rm in Venetian Tower.
668	Overall we had a great time.
668	Food/service/amenities are excellent, as always.
669	The Venetian Hotel and Resort is absolutely amazing!
669	I would highly recommend it to anyone.
669	The suites are spacious and have all the amenities you would ever need.
669	Every area of the hotel was spotless at all times.
669	The staff was very helpful and friendly.
669	The one and only problem we had was trying to connect to the wifi ...
669	it was not reliable.
669	I can't wait to go back!
670	The problem I had, after waiting in a long line to check in, I told the front desk clerk I needed a shuttle to the airport the day I checked out.
670	He told me to check with the Concierge would help me with that, I then stood in another long line to find out the shuttles come every hour outside.
670	I felt the front desk should have known that instead of wasting my time with another long line.
671	This hotel was unbelievable in every way.
671	The décor was amazing, so many fine restaurants, great location on the strip.
671	Our room was the smallest of the suites and it was still 650 sq ft, with a step down into our living room.
671	I would recommend this hotel and next time I'm in Vegas I will stay here again.
671	You feel like you are in Italy.
674	Passing through town and needed a place to stay
675	Exceptional job by staff and fabulous facility, made our short four day trip to Las Vegas a REAL TREAT!
676	good clean quiet room security at the elevator enterance ensures only people staying there are in the hotel areas.
676	Only two negatives was wifi that dropped frequently and no complimentary coffee in the room.
676	Makes first thing in the morning very difficult.
677	This hotel is just beautiful.
677	Located right in the middle of the strip it is very well located for all areas of Vegas.
677	It is huge with loads of shopping, eating and entertainment.
677	Rooms were beautiful and cleaned to a very high standard.
677	We were there for Christmas but be warned it is colder than you think but hotel has heated pool and hot tubs on 8th floor if you can brave running from the beds to the pool.
679	Won money at their casino!
679	Excellent bundle of hotel, fun, food!
680	Overall a good hotel, all suites, very clean throughout.
680	The suites are very comfortable though a little dark due to the tinted windows.
681	Outstanding customer service and friendliness.
681	Will definitely stay again.
682	Very nice hotel, one of the better stays in Vegas.
683	Having stayed at some of the other ""5-star"" hotels such as Bellagio and Cosmopolitan, the Venetian is not worth the money, particularly for a group of guys.
683	This trip was a bachelor party with 8 guys in our mid-30's.
683	Overall, we all felt our money would have been spent somewhere else.
683	While the rooms are suites and were clean and comfortable, some of them have pretty pathetic views, such as mine which faced a wall.
683	The location is alright, but somewhat isolated from any of the newer areas in the heart of the Strip.
683	The main pool is pretty unimpressive for such a well-kept, new property.
683	In fact, the amount of seating is totally inadequate to the point it is full by 10 am.
683	The biggest disappointment was the service/assistance, or lack thereof, from the concierge.
683	Besides the lines always being ridiculous, we were pretty shocked when they advised they didn't offer any sort of discount or priority entrance to the bars/clubs located in our hotel (TAO or Lavo).
683	In order to even get in, they wanted us to each pay $80 per person, which is more than someone walking in from the street would pay at the door.
683	While most Vegas clubs require a certain guy-to-girl ratio, most hotels on the Strip provide a benefit to their guests in terms of a priority line or discount on the entrance.
683	The Venetian does not so guys going out in groups might want to spend their money somewhere else which offers some better value.
687	There are few in the next level of cost but of the Hotels in this price range the Venetian is hands down superior!
688	Impressive but excessive charges for everything.
688	Save your money and stay elsewhere, as with all Vegas hotels you are free to walk in and see it all without being a guest!
689	Impressive hotel, nice location in the ""middle"" of the strip.
689	Service is good but feels kind of distant (maybe the more than 7000 rooms is the reason).
690	I loved the experience it was just a little too short 2 days.
690	I loved the whole experience of my stay.
690	The hotel rooms where clean and smelled clean.
690	Service was very good.
690	Hotel Amenities where to par.
690	Hotel location was good on the strip .
691	The hotel is beautiful and close to the middle of the strip, so all exploring is within reasonable walking distance.
691	The staff were very helpful and friendly to my group with putting rooms close together and providing extra towels.
691	Would absolutely stay there again
692	I was very happy with this decisionabout this hotel ilike alot everything for me was excellent i cannot complain about anything
693	It was a girl's trip - 4 of us stayed in one room which worked because of the overall size of the space - no one got in anyone else's way.
693	Even the bathrooms were big enough!
693	Clean, good view - good location.
693	Would recommend to others.
694	My new favorite hotel on the strip.
694	Hotel is kept well and very clean.
694	The room was spacious and comfortable.
694	Will be staying here again.
695	It is at the centre of the strip.
695	Itself is a big complex.
695	Good thing is it has free self parking facilities.
695	However, not extra fridge space for your own stuff.
696	A luxurious hotel and suite.
696	Courteous, efficient service.
696	You could easily spend a day just in the hotel itself.
696	Conveniently located on The Strip.
696	We were a little disappointed that the internal canal was being refurbished during our stay & thus, the gondolas were not operating.
696	However, there were a few operating outdoors in a small area at the front of the hotel.
697	Good location (nicer part of the strip).
697	Lots of bars and restaurants (although a bit pricy and small portions).
697	Good size rooms (suites).
697	The pool water is not heated, so although it was 30C and packed poolside, very few people were actually in the pool.
697	The lighting in the room and bathroom is not very good, it's never bright enough!
697	Also the $25/day resort fee at the end of the stay is a bit of a bummer - it's a mandatory fee so they should include it in the price rather than slap you with it when you really don't have a choice anymore.
697	$25/day for free WIFI is really ridiculous.
698	Definitely enjoyed my stay and would stay there again and again and again!
698	The staff was awesome and the room was beautiful, clean and spacious.
698	The hotel and room was way more beautiful then I expected.
698	Anyone who is deciding if they should stay here, please do.
698	It's so beautiful...
698	I could go on.
698	The view from the bedroom was great as well.
698	The price was good for this type of room.
698	In all, I would recommend the Venetian to anyone.
699	Too many guests and not enough space.
699	Waited too long for wait staff at restaurants.
699	Very difficult to find a chaise at the pool -many people had left their chaise, but the staff was unable to recognize when they had gone so lounges were not cleared.
699	The place looked like a mess of chairs covered with used towels.
699	My suite was nice...
699	Even good art on the walls.
699	The salon is a nice facility; I enjoyed my manicure and pedicure.
699	The Spa is okay...
699	disappointed by the cracked ceilings and what appeared to be mold growing in the tile grout of the igloo room.
699	All-in-all: Pretty good.
699	More value here than at the Belagio.
699	I could have stayed at the Four Seasons for the same price.
699	Next time I probably will.
700	This hotel is the best Vegas experience we've had to date.
700	The staff is excellent, there are plenty of eating options within the hotel, it's close to major attractions, has great shows...
702	From the time we arrived to the time we departed our stay was just wonderful.
702	Everyone was so helpful and courteous.
702	The hotel is just amazing and the room we had had a great view and very clean and comfortable.
702	I will be back.
703	We will go back to the same Hotel.
703	Many restaurants and a food court on site.
703	You don't have to go out for dinner.
705	Light and airy casino compared to others, great shopping facilities, some great restaurant and bars to suit all tastes and budgets, awesome show Rock of Ages was on when we were there which I highly recommend.
705	Go for the breakfast at the cafe closest to the lifts for the suites great price at twenty dollars all you can eat buffet which is very reasonable compared to others.
705	The suites are lovely try and get a high room more to get away from the strip noise but the view is as you expect very good if you can get one of the strip that is.
705	All in all a very good hotel which I would go back to without hesitation.
706	Fabulous experience,will return some day
707	The location is great.
707	My wife could walk to the Fashion show mall and the cab ride to the North Outlets was only $22.
707	Only thing to be aware of if the 'Sedan scam'.
707	My wife and I exited the hotel to grab a taxi and a gentlemen was standing there in a suit and eager to help us out.
707	He said a cab would be a few minutes or ""for a little but more"" we could leave immediately in a sedan.
707	We took the Sedan(duh in hindsight) and never asked rate(double duh) - but we trusted who we thought was the Venetian valet.
707	Turns out the valet isn't an employee of the hotel, he represents the Sedan company and is there to trick guests into using their Sedans.
707	We were charged $49 instead of $20-22.
707	We complained to the hotel who deflected to the Valet Mgr, Jimmy - who handled it very well.
707	We were more than compensated but $ wasn't the point.
707	I'm surprised that the Venetian would allow this on their property.
708	The elegance and great customer service live on.
708	Impeccable rooms and improved service(I.e.
708	early coffee at Bouchon) are a welcome change
709	We had a great time!
709	The suit we stayed was marvelous!
709	Great location and wonderful pools!
709	We would defenetly visit again soon,
710	but a little dust on the table
711	Great vacation spot I will book This hotel again.
711	Nice romantic gondola ride with live singers that actually perform really well.
712	Now our favorite hotel in Vegas.
712	Outstanding in every way.
712	Must see the 'Frank' show...
713	Our stay was wonderful and security was great but I had an issue about the daily mandatory resort fee and I could not access the internet.
713	I eventually had to purchase a data plan from Apple so I could keep up with my business.
714	Beautiful and breath-taking hotel.
714	Beacause of its size, service gets sacrificed a bit, but no different than any of the other Vegas gargantuans.
715	We upgraded from a Luxury room and stayed at the Rialto room.
715	This room is spacious and our family of four stayed there comfortably for 5 days.
715	The hotel sits on the strip which makes it a convenient location or starting point of your Vegas trip.
715	The upkeep of the room was pretty decent, it was clean, and comfortable.
715	The amenities were very good.
715	Overall, a good value for your money by Las Vegas standards.
716	The travel site said this was a 5 star hotel.
716	The valet parking/luggage operation is an absolute abysmal mess.
716	Took the hotel multiple calls and several hours to replace the primary light bulb in the room.
716	Security screens individuals Costco-style going to guest rooms which can add time/hassle.
716	Hotel is laid out in an incredibly confusing and illogical manner.
716	Needs a redo in signage to be sure.
716	Was chock full of drunk college students.
716	Hot tub was small and tepid.
716	Would never stay there again.
716	Hotel took a $100 deposit on my Amex card at check-in, which was fine.
716	When I tried to charge a coffee to the suite I was told such charges were not authorized.
716	When I asked why, I was told such charges required a $150 deposit.
716	I asked why the hotel hadn't authorized this without requiring me to make such a decision.
716	Front desk staff was curt and did not seem to care.
716	Why make your guest make such a choice?
716	Charge the dumb deposit and make it so that I don't have to think about such things.
717	The $100 deposit take 5-7 business days to be remove
718	Like most of the casinos and hotels in Vegas, if you're not a smoker, then you are going to suffer big time .
718	Even on our non-smoking floor there were people hanging out in the hallways smoking .
718	but overall a very nice hotel, but pricey - especially when there is an event in town!
719	We have stayed here before & always come back for the beautiful setting.
719	Everything is first class!
719	Our only problem is getting lost as the property is huge but there is always someone to direct us.
722	The room was beautiful.
722	But staff was rude.
722	The fridge had left overs from the previous guest.
722	When i asked for extra towels, i was going to be charged.
722	Even though there wad a pamphlet that stated i would be brought extra towels ""upon request"".
722	I was informed by the front desk that the housekeepers dont always clean all rooms because there's over 7,000 rooms which makes it impossible for them to clean ever room.
722	Overall, i wouldn't stay there again.
723	In room dining is VERY disappointing, 2 orders and not one of them delivered correctly, neverlone the fact we had to ring and find out if breakfast was ever going to be sent up, over half an hour late and they still got it wrong!
724	Beautiful hotel, the room very spacious and the location on the strip was very good we also had wifi in the room.
724	There was also a separate lounge area and the view of the strip was amazing!
725	Gorgeous suite rooms, with super comfy beds.
725	Staff is very friendly and helpful.
725	Loved the different pools the hotel offers.
725	The shops has a good variety of stores, where you can find great buys.
725	You can party at night at Tao Nightclub and Tao Beach in the day.
726	AND SERVICE, BELL STAND ON CHECK OUT WAS THE ONLY SORE SPOT IN THE ENTIRE VISIT, VERY SLOW AND UNCOORDINATED
728	Pro's - Exceptional location centered on strip with easy access to best shopping, hotels, etc.- hotel staff discounted us due to a couple of problems in our room (bath tap very low flow, curtains didn't work, grease smell)Cons- very busy hotel, grease smell coming from air vents in rooms, spa is now getting dated.
729	I was amazed by the mall and the rooms, very beautiful design in the outside and the inside.
730	Quality top of the line food, beautiful pools and an awesome facility along with a clean gorgeous room and a professional staff made for an extremely pleasurable stay.
731	Very pleased with the rooms.
731	Large comfortable and clean.
731	Staff were very nice.
731	Wle did have an issue that was taking care of in a timely manner.
732	My daughter stayed at the Venetian for her birthday and they really made her stay special.
732	Little extras, great service and very friendly staff made the trip a wonderful experience.
732	Thanks for being a classy, over the top hotel and definitely a place we will return to over other hotels we have stayed at in the past.
734	I am extremely happy I stayed at the Venetian, Las Vegas...
734	the suite is very roomy and clean...
734	the staff were very courteous and professional...
734	always there when u need them...
734	well maintained suite...
734	had some problems with the in room safe...
734	but everything else in the room worked perfectly fine...
735	I had been to Vegas a few times before, but this time decided to try a new spot and selected the Venetian, based on location and price for wanting a better-than-average experience to celebrate a bachelorette weekend.
735	Pleasantly surprised to check in and find that our room felt like a suite!
735	A great room layout and lots of space!
735	The hotel itself is gorgeous - the pool area was perfect for sun throughout the day.
735	Could hear all of the music from Tao Beach, so got a little of the ""party experience"" without having to be in the smaller pool area there.
735	Restaurant selection throughout the hotel was fantastic as well.
735	Would definitely recommend staying here - I'll be back for sure!
737	First impression was WOW,,,,,, until we got our room, 1 super king bed, wonderful we thought, now where do our 2 children sleep?
737	On the sofa bed were told, I think not, I don't come on holiday too move fiurniture about every morning/night making sofa beds up, (moan over).
737	Eventually offered a different room with 2 double beds but in the (Venezia) not as nice but a bigger room.
737	Cleanliness of hotel was outstanding , pools nice but looking a bit tired, shopping mall very nice, restaurants lovely, very disappointed indoor Gondola closed, due to re-open October?
737	, outside open, the size of a large swimming pool, Round it once at a cost of $17 each.
737	Would not stay here again think it would deffo be the WYNN...
738	We stayed for 9 nights and the room was not clean as we thought it would be considering the type of Hotel, great staff and hotel services.
739	Our hotel room was great, clean and well appointed.
739	The staff were helpful and very attentive.
739	My only complaint was the door lock on our room would occasionally not accept our keys.
739	Otherwise this was a very positive experience, and I highly recommend the Venetian Hotel.
741	Stayed in the Venezia Tower and loved it.
741	The room was huge with a sunken sitting area, 2 tv's , very comfortable beds and huge bathroom also.
741	Plenty of room and very clean.
742	We recently enjoyed the comfort of the Rialto Suite at the Venetian Las Vegas.
742	From the moment we entered, we were pleasantly greeted by all the staff, despite the beginning of a busy summer weekend.
742	When queues were long, I noticed extra staff was brought in to help with the guests.
742	At Check-in, Keeley was super friendly, she helped us arrange the best comfort stay.
742	The room was 1100 square feet, spacious for four.
742	I believe the rialto suites tend to be near the elevator, which were sweet for our feet.
742	Overall, had a fun time, thank you Venetian.
742	PS: Booked this trip with expedia, as usual, great experience during the booking process and also love the no hassle at the end with check out.
743	I liked the restaurants, clean casinos and the atmosphere
744	Really liked the large suite in the Venetian, but it was a terrible shame that we paid $25 a day for room service coffee as there was none in the room.
744	The Wolfgang Puck restaurant CUT was simply amazing (one of the best meals ever) and the Mario Batelli Carnevino was a pretty awesome culinary experience as well.
744	Check out the crepes in the food court and steer clear of the pizza.
744	I would go back to the Venetian but probably check out another hotel the next time I am there.
745	Suite had exquisite views of the Strip and mountains beyond.
745	Upgraded to a marvellous suiteRestaurants are varied and food is good to great
747	The room and bathroom were excellent.
747	The view was non existent as we were on the 3rd floor though.
747	We left just as ravers for the EDC weekend arrived so we were lucky as they were VERY loud
748	I have stayed in other hotels on or near the strip, this by far was the best.
749	Such a large complex we spent 6 lovely days here, It is so amazing to take in the adventures and walks you can go on to take in the huge expance of this glorious building you could spend all your time at the hotel and not venture outside.
749	The weather was not warm enough to be around the pool area to which I think would have been our only dissapointment as looking at the location of were it was and after talking to other guestswho had tried to sit outside it was like a trapped wind tunnel for its locaion as it is sited on the inside and wrapped around the Ventian Tower ( our room overlooked the pool area )we were told their was another Pool area in the Venezia side over the other side of the bulidng.
750	Had a great time!
750	5 night 6 day.
750	The Venetian and the Palazzo are gorgeous.
750	You really feel like you're in Venice!
751	Would love to come back.
751	Had some trouble with check in and had a hard time finding our way to the room the first time...
751	Also asked for something that was supposed to be in the room already and it never came...
751	had to call again the next day!
752	Wonderful Hotel amazing staff and facilities.
752	Everything about this place is perfect!
752	I would recommend to anyone
753	we ordered just four forks deliver to our suite but it took one hour.
753	was not happy at all.
754	Such a fantastic trip.
754	The Venetian is by far one of my favourite places to stay in Vegas.
754	I one thing I'd say that could have been better was the pull out bed for 2. It's barely big enough for 1 person and very uncomfortable.
754	It's basically springs with a bit of cushion.
754	Other than that the stay was spectacular.
754	Great nightclub, restaurants, casino and shops etc. would definitely stay there again!
756	Initially we had a rude concierge who was adamant that our selected room we had paid for was not available for the first night, but after kicking up a stink it somehow become available.
756	Great room however it took a while for things to be fixed when they were not damaged by us.
757	It was hot in Vegas when we were there- the ac in our room ran all the time and our room was never cool.
757	We were in the Venezia suites.
757	That tower is forever for everything and is a hassle to go up to the 4th fl then get on another elevator to go to the 12th floor.
757	I do not like that the Venetian does not have a direct route from the strip to get into the hotel.
757	I find backtracking or having to go through the canal shops to be a nuisance.
757	We stayed here at the request of the couple we were traveling with.
757	The Venetian is not my favorite place to stay in Vegas.
758	The room was big, clean and the quiet part of the hotel.
758	I's very pleased with the free ticket to the great show.
759	Venetian is a terrific hotel and great location...
759	staff were very friendly...
760	Great hotel with beautiful, large rooms!
760	We found the restaurants and coffee shops within the hotel quite expensive, but there is a food-fair in Grand Canal Shop area on the second floor of the hotel, where prices are a bit more reasonable.
761	Our experience as far as the Venitian hotel/resort was perfectly pleasurable, comfortable, lavish.
761	The only drawback were the prices for food and decent food experiences at the Venitian.
761	Definitely needed some middle of the road options for those who do not want to splurge on lavish expensive meals all the time but still want a decent dining experience, not fast food or buffet style.
762	We brought our two kids ages 5 and 8 with us.
762	This was an interim stop on our way back to the East Coast from a ski trip in Montana.
762	We thought it would be fun to spend a couple of days in Las Vegas to show the kids Hoover Dam, etc.They enjoyed the Gondola rides, the Secret Garden at Mirage (Lions, Tigers, and Dolphins), the free street performance at St. Marks square, and the swimming pools on the 10th floor.
762	I wouldn't say that Vegas is really that great for kids but we did find plenty to keep them occupied and were able to check the States of Nevada and Arizona (Arizona for crossing Hoover Dam) off of the list of States we have visited.
762	This hotel was great for the size of the rooms, the location on the strip, and the upkeep of the facility.
762	It is very close to a Denny's if you want to escape the higher priced resort food and there is a food court located within the canal shops that has kid friendly food.
763	Check out was hectic as I had to wait for an hour for my bags and car...
764	They were so accommodating when I needed help with some business and personal issues.
765	The Venetian is the only place to stay in las vegas.
765	Each room (suite) is huge with two big-screen TV's, and there's even a small TV in the bathroom.
765	To enter the elevators to get to your room, you must show your room key to a guard - we felt like we received the utmost respect from all of the staff.
765	We thoroughly enjoyed the show, ""Rock of Ages,"" which was at The Venetian.
765	It was truly one of the best shows we've ever been to - we sat in the 4th row in the middle and were extremely satisfied with both our seats and the performance - we'd give it a 5 star rating.
765	One of the BEST restaurants in The Venetian is the, ""Grand Lux Cafe.
765	""  Not only do they have one of the most varied menus we'd ever seen, but the food AND service were wonderful.
765	One of our waitresses, Julia B., was super friendly and extremely accommodating, checking with us several times to see how we were doing.
765	Last but not least, love love loved the swimming pool and the food at the restaurant (don't remember the name) outdoors at the pool.
766	The hotel was very nice, the room was spacious and very nice.
766	The only con I would have is that the hotel is at the end of the strip so there was a lot walking then say staying in the middle of the strip.
766	Still I would choose to stay at this hotel again.
767	I stayed at the Venetian resort for one night after driving 6 hours from LA.
767	I stayed at the hotel several years ago before; the experience was the same, excellent in every way and category.
767	During the checkout I complained about not being able to connect to the internet, they immediately waived the resort fee.
767	My flight was in the evening, I was able to leave my luggage and valley parked car at the hotel for the entire day at no additional cost, I was treated like royalty all the time.
768	The only staff person that went out of his way to help us with anything was Miles.
769	The hotel was amazing, arrived early and got an upgrade since our room was not available.
769	Very clean, beautiful view.
770	It was a phenomenal place to stay, the rooms are amazing and the location is great.
770	The hotel itself has lots of shops and places to eat.
770	Great spot for anyone and everyone.
771	Bella suite was perfect.
771	Beds were so comfy and room luxurious even if it took 5 mins to walk down the end of the corridor to get to it.
771	Venetian is a beautiful hotel but so very busy all the time.
771	As we were travelling with our son aged 8 we actually found the Luxor was more relaxing to stay in and walk round as less busy.
771	Location excellent right near all the action.
771	All in all it was a lovely place to stay on the last few days of our visit.
772	The room smelled like stale smoke the minibar did not work when we called down waited on hold for 10 minutes .
772	At 5:00 am drunk man was pounding on our door called down again got through and 15 minutes of pounding later they finally came up at that point was up for the day last day there really a long day when you land at home in the central time zone at 12:30 overall the room was run down and smelled.
772	I have stayed in numerous hotels in Las Vegas over the years and this was by far the worst stay in the last 25 years .
772	I will not stay there again back to Caesars
773	The rooms were the largest we have been in on the strip.
773	Every thing was clean.
773	The pools were great.
774	One of the best hotels in Vegas...
774	Clean, great restaurants...
775	The room darkening shades are wonderful and the beds very comfortable.
775	Nice location on the strip.
777	I was extremely disappointed at Venetian Hotel.
777	When I checked out from the hotel a couple days ago, I would like to use my travelers' checks (issued by AE) to pay for resort fees.
777	The female clerk refused to accept the travelers' checks.
777	With her elegant attitude and voice, she even said it's simply against HER policy to do so.
777	I was surprised Venetian does not accept travelers' checks which even small family-owned restaurants in US commonly accept.
777	The client-facing employees appears to be tacking adequate training.
777	I will never come back to Venetian Hotel because of this experiences.
778	We had a great time!
778	The room was very nice, the best part was the in-suite breakfast!
778	It was a great set up and the food was very good.
779	Outstanding service and hospitality
780	Great overall experience would stay again and again
781	My room had dirty sheets that were stained with rust and disgusting.
781	There was also leftover food from the previous person who stayed in the room in the refrigerator.
781	When I told the staff member she didnt seem to care.
783	We are from canada n get short vacation to vegas.
783	this is the best hotel facilities and comfortable n friendly staff!
785	My husband & I celebrated our 50th anniversary here!
785	We had a great time seeing shows,sunbathing by the pool,shopping, & gambling.
786	Perfect location  bathroom clean but I expect more
787	Everything about The Venetian is fantastic!
787	Staff very attentive and accommodating, Our room was was amazing!
787	Classy, elegant and enormous!
787	We would'nt stay anywhere else.
787	It was a home away from home!
787	One thing that I was disappointed with was the room upgrade.
787	Our room was facing roof tops with huge air conditioner units.
787	I dont like to complain.
787	For a upgrade we were expecting at least a pool view!
787	We loved being on the 24th floor .
787	Maybe next time we can get a better view!
787	See you next year!
788	When we checked in the young lady at the reception desk, she was extremely helpful and pleasant.
788	She said she had upgraded our room.
788	She went on to say it was a smoking room, but there was a separate bedroom.
788	We went to the suite only to find that it was a hospitality suite and there was no bedroom.
788	We called down to the desk, but we were on hold forever, so we took our luggage and went back to the check-in desk.
788	We told the same young lady that there was no bedroom and she said there was.
788	I asked her to get a staff member to come up to the room and show me where the bedroom was.
788	She replied in a very condescending tone that they do not have any staff who could go up to the room to ""tour it"".
788	She became very argumentative with my husband who at that point asked to speak to the manager.
788	We did find out that there was a bed in the wall...
788	very different from what she told us.
788	He did put us in a proper suite which had a separate bedroom.
789	We stayed at the Venetian for my 40th Birthday celebration.
789	I will say that it is one of the most beautiful hotels I have stayed in and the staff was wonderful, very helpful with any and every question.
789	Couple things did annoy me- the hotel allows folks from the Grandview Hotel who are selling timeshares to solicit.
789	The soliciters themselves are not rude in any way (they are always pleasant when you say no) but they approach you at all entrances and exits after a while the repetition becomes aggravating.
789	We did figure out if walking apart will throw them off but really shouldn't have to do this in a 5star hotel.
789	The hotel offers snacks in the room (that are sensor controlled by the way so if you touch it you bought it# however in our room there was dust a quarter inch high on the snack boxes- obviuosly I didn't take advantage, first because most likely stale products and the expense go to the Walgreens in Hotel As for food, ate at First Food and Bar which is in the hotel because we were given a coupon during checkin but the food was not worth the money charged, I.e $25 for a philly cheesesteak that was full of cheese and according to my husband fatty.
789	They did make good drinks #bloody mary was outstanding) and the black bean soup was to die for also staff was very friendly.
789	We also ate at Taqueria Canonita and Zefferinos and the food and service was awesome.
789	Regardless of my own personal concerns, the hotel was worth it as the other amenities made up for the discrepencies.
790	We had 3 Venezia suites.
790	To say they were a long walk from the reception and casino is an understatement.
790	It was 2 elevators and a 10 minute walk away.
790	Obviously the hotel is large but the layout has much to be desired.
790	First thoughts of the room were plush, but on closer inspection found it wasn't cleaned to the standard that a 4* let alone a 5* should be.
790	The table had stains on them.
790	The bathtub wasn't clean.
790	I have stayed in 4 other 5* hotels in Las Vegas and they all provided complimentary water in the rooms as well as had electric curtains and light switches by the bed.
790	I know these aren't major points but you expect a certain quality for arguably the best hotel in Vegas and this didn't have it.
790	The light switches were the most annoying as you end up gripping up on your way back to bed or having to use your phone light.
790	There is also no convenient plug point near the bed for phone charging.
790	House keeping wasn't great either.
790	Rooms were cleaned but clothes weren't tidied up.
790	One day our room wasn't even cleaned!
790	Otherwise it's a pretty awesome hotel for amenities.
790	Pools, casino, restaurants, shopping center all within the complex.
791	Great room enjoyed the stay only thing was we had a additional resort fee.
792	Very nice hotel & location but it is starting to show its age compared to some 5 star competitors.
792	No complaints except my drink glasses were dirty & some of the furniture was dusty.
793	This hotel is one of the best in Vegas and it maintains its service level as the price you pay there is no question about it.
793	Venetian is big has shops and restaurant inside the complexThe swimming pool is great there are parties almost everyday there.
793	Checking in and checking out is really fast and convenient.
796	We really enjoyed our stay!
796	Clean rooms and helpful staff.
797	The hallway noise echos throughout your room all night long.
797	I've never stayed in a hotel where the hallway noise came into the room so badly.
798	Our room had a wonderful view for a small upgrade fee.
798	Suites were well designed and furnished.
798	Definitely 5 star service, location was perfect as it is close to any type of activity you would seek in Vegas.
798	Wonderful Italian restaurants in Their Shoppes.
799	The only thing I would say is the hotel should dust the rooms once in a while.
799	The rest of the stay was nice.
799	Very large rooms, nice staff, very accommodating and we had a nice time.
801	Very attentive staff from our arrival until departure.
801	We went to Otto's pizzeria and B&B Burger for lunch and Table 10 for dinner all three were excellent though a little pricey but hey your in Vegas also the gym is the best hotel gym I've ever seen it's almost a full sized gym overall it's a great hotel
802	Everytime I have stayed here, there has been no complaints whatsoever, very clean, friendly staff, security was pretty tight too, which is good.
803	Great staff I sandwich $50.
803	and I got an upgrade with the resort fees waived which was about $150.
804	We only stayed one night as we came in to see Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.
804	Our room was beautiful and very convenient.
804	We went down the elevator and we were at the concert.
804	Beds were very comfortable and room was very clean.
804	Would stay again in a heartbeat.
805	Superb room, great choice of excellent restaurants, and in excellent location.
806	Originally booked a room in the Venetian because of our wonderful experience there on previous trips, but had to take a similar room in the Palazzo this time because the Venetian did not have availability for the type of room we requested.
806	Check-in was quick and easy.
806	Staff was very helpful.
806	There was a bit of a delay getting our bags to the room since we had to switch to the Palazzo.
806	The room at the Palazzo was the same set-up and view, and the comfort and cleanliness of the room were excellent.
807	Room was spacious and clean.
807	Did not feel it was worth the price.
807	Everything in the room was extra.
807	They added resort fee which is ridiculous as all that it has is Gym and swimming pool which every hotel has these days.
808	This hotel was absolutely inviting and entertaining.
808	The staff were very pleasant and helpful.
808	I would recommend this hotel 100%.
809	Had a great room with a balcony and view of the pool,
810	Had a lovely stay at Venetian , Las vegas last week .
810	The staff was friendly but the best part is the hotel itself .
810	It feels as if you are in a palace with the room size of minimum 650 sq.
810	ft , the suite feel is mind boggling with lots of space for everything .
810	not to mention 1 huge TV in the bedroom and 1 in the living room plus a small one in the bathroom .
810	Overall an excellent hotel .
812	First of all, suite was great, it was pretty big.
812	but only problem we had.
812	in suite doesn't have microwave, also fridge was full of drinks.
812	there weren't any space their to put food or others drinks.
812	also if we want to heat the food how we can do it?
812	we paid almost 400 dollar for one night and suite was not even have these things.
812	that's not good at all.
814	This hotel is beautiful...
814	always a but in here...
814	LOLNot much staff around to help REALLY wish room had a fridge and a coffee maker.
814	Water, sodas, coffee, etc are really spendy in Vegas so it would be nice to have cold ones in our room.
814	Also, come on, it's over 110 Degrees outside...
816	VERY GOOD FOOD CHOICES  AND LOCATION!
817	Great time, great food.
817	We stayed for the May-Pac fight and even though the fight was underwhelming the hotel made us happy we chose this location.
818	Haven't been to Las Vegas in many years and I was amazed at all the changes.
818	Couldn't have picked a more beautiful place to celebrate a family member's birthday.
818	Great amenities, great staff, wonderful suites, numerous restaurants.
818	We'll definitely be back to stay at the Venitian!
819	Beautiful hotel, located in the middle of the action.
819	Rooms are very stylish, clean and comfortable.
819	Very large hotel, certainly lots of walking to get coffee or food.
819	Everything you would expect at an upscale, Las Vegas hotel.
819	We found the staff ok, not rude but not overly helpful.
820	The room was amazing, we arrive around 9am and they were very friendly allowing us to check in early and paying the room upgrade with the view and they waive the early check in fee.
820	Would definitely stay here again for my next visit
821	This was my first time staying at the Venetian.
821	I was impressed with the beauty and comfort of the hotel.
821	The room was very comfortable and very clean.
821	We stayed in on the recently renovated suites.
821	The bedding was soft and I slept very well.
821	The room was spacious and decorated very lovely.
821	From the check-in to the check-out, all staff that we interacted with very helpful.
821	There is a lot to see and do on the property and after seeing the other casinos on the strip, I will probably stay again at the Venetian for future Vegas trips.
822	The Venetian is beautifully decorated and modern with good facilities.
822	The suite is spacious with all mid cons provided.
822	The hotel is huge with loads of shops, eating places and of course the casino.
822	Location wise it is very central on the strip.
823	Only downside was how far the room was to the casino floor but I would imagine all large hotels are the same, would definitely return :)
824	We had stayed at the Venetian Hotel numerous times approx 3 years ago.
824	The rooms have not been kept up and were very disappointing especially for the high price we paid.
824	There was mold in the shower, furniture was dirty and not kept up, the tables were scratched, the air conditioning did not cool the bedroom area of the suite and the windows were covered with fingerprints etc. I would not stay there again as we have enjoyed other numerous hotels on the strip much more.
826	we have stayed here before and each stay has been wonderfull.
829	Amazing hotel with all the amenities.
829	Everyone was so helpful and polite.
829	When I got lost (huge resort with 3 towers) I was personally escorted by staff to my destination.
829	Got to experience their Carnavale with venetian characters in costume, great photo opp.
832	Very disappointed, had a much more enjoyable experience at the Trump when I stayed in Vegas last year.
832	Hotel was more family orientated, staff don't really care.
832	Tags on the food in the room...
832	Children will obviously touch these and when your credit card is tagged to your room you will know all about it.
832	I was EXTREMLY disappointed how I had to spend so much money just to print my boarding passes.
832	Trump had me print my passes for FREE.
832	That's right, free.
832	Trump supplied a fridge in the room to keep our water cool, venetian prices are ridiculously high.
832	If you want an enjoyable stay at Vegas, stay at trump and save yourself time, patients and money.
833	Great place to stay in middle of everything!
833	Clubs, gambling, and food are all great times to enjoy
834	We had a great time at the Venetian.
834	Food, shopping, spa and of course gaming :) Make sure you pick up a players card as we had all the spa services and one night stay complimentary!
834	A great place to stay and play.
835	Fantastic hotel with all the comforts of home and more.
835	The staff were great and very helpful.
835	We had one issue when there was no water on our floor for washing and other things!
835	we went to reception and they gave us a free meal in any restaurant in the hotel as a way of saying sorry.
835	Apart from that the whole expedience was fantastic.
836	Staff were lovely pleasant.
836	Hotel lovely but huge took two lifts and 15 minutes to get to my room but i would stay there again
839	Love the rooms in the hotel.
839	Its my favorite place on the strip
842	My husband and I, married 15 years and with 3 children, went away on our own (well-needed) and found upon arrival that the Venetian was the only resort that would be perfect for us.
842	This resort is upscale, the service and cleanliness are impeccable, the quality of the restaurants and amenties are excellent.
842	We upgraded upon arrival to a Piazza Suite, which was 1450 square feet, for only $99 extra per night and it was well worth it!
842	There was never a line at check in or check out.
842	We also had an amazing time at the Tao Night Club on Thursday Night and saw David Spade right in the theater in the hotel.
842	This resort has endless shops, restaurants and entertatinment.
842	There is really no reason to leave this particular hotel to try other hotels.
842	It was a dream stay.
842	We will be back!
843	Every thing was absolutely.
843	I was however missing coffee/tea maker in the room, which as far as I know is an American standard.
844	We were asked to upgrade from the Bella suite to a newly renovated Bella suite.
844	We got nothing different as the room was clearly not recently renovated.
844	So it cost us 50 plus a night extra for nothing.
844	Behind the curtains were big hair balls that clearly hadn't been cleaned for sometime.
844	The  third day there my son realized that one of his sports hats was missing.
844	It doesn't sound like much but I would expect more from the Venetian staff.
844	I was a little disappointed as my first stay there 5 years ago was excellent.
844	At checkout I mentioned the missing hat to the lady at the counter and she really didn't have any concern she just told me to go to the lost and found.
844	It wasn't lost it was stolen.
844	Again  I know it's just a $40 hat but it's the  principal.
844	Anyways I think that's the last time I recommend or go to the Venetian.
844	There's a lot better hotels like the Vadara or Elara Hilton grand Vacation.
844	Beautiful rooms and reasonably priced.
844	We left stuff out in the room there with no troubles.
845	Came for a girls trip with my best friend.
845	Room was very large, which was nice.
845	View was nice, beds were comfortable, bathroom nice and clean.
845	The casino was nice and bright, and very well ventilated.
845	One of my biggest pet peeves about Vegas is the smoke everywhere, the Venetian casino is much better than most at clearing it out.
845	Enjoyed the restaurants on site, lots of excellent places to choose from.
845	My friend loved shopping at the Venetian shoppes, found it hard to believe we weren't outside.
845	Found the hotel staff to be very friendly, but also efficient.
845	Our last day at the hotel we got breakfast delivered to our room, the server was fantastic, very accommodating, even when dealing with my Celiac disease.
845	Wish I could remember her name, I appreciated the extra care she put into my food.
845	Very little negative to say.
845	The handle into our toilet stall was broken, very loose, so we were scared to pull it fully shut in case we got stuck in there.
845	Of course, there's a phone in there, so could've called the hotel to get saved!
845	The shower heat level was very hit and miss.
845	It took forever to get hot, so it would be a lot of luke warm water, leaving us shivering, until all of a sudden it would get scalding hot.
845	Had a great trip, would definitely stay there again!
846	This is the most beautiful Five star hotel ,ill ever been through, for sure i will recomend this again and again
847	Room is lovely, very good location, several restaurants right on site all seem excellent.
847	Really I have no complaints at all
848	Stayed with my husband and daughter in the mini suite - did not pay extra for a view but when the check in guy heard it was my 50th birthday, he placed us in the highest available room (23rd) with a pool view and a partial strip view.
848	Concierge was fabulous, scoring tickets to a show with prices competitive with the discount show websites.
848	Beautifully appointed room, lovely decor.
848	The ONLY issue we had was running out of toilet paper on day 2 of our stay...
848	housekeeping double stocked us on day 3, LOL.
848	Very highly recommend, well stay there again.
849	We loved the hotel and will recommend to family and friends if they ever visit Las Vegas
851	Room was great...
851	lots of space, but needs more lighting and TV remotes didnt work well.
852	we had a wonderful stay!
852	no glitches the room amd hotel were amazing,close to everything,security was great.
852	Rooms were soundproof and very private after a long day of shopping.
852	The hotel staff were very helpful.
852	I look forward to return on my next trip to Las Vegas.
854	very cozy, good station, but a litte dusty on the table
855	I enjoyed my stay over all.
855	Just had a lot of inconvenience for a 5 star hotel as Venetian.
856	Would stay here again.
856	Excellent service from the following individuals :  Christopher (Valet Service)., Tunde (In Room Dinning who took our order, she has excellent customer service skills),  Steve, (the waiter who delivered our food), very personable, set up everything with kindness and answered questions of concerns.
856	Sparkle, (Housekeeping Room Attendant), exceptional service provided to Room 12-210, she made sure our needs were met.
856	The above individuals deserve to be highly praised .
856	Please see to it that the hotel receives this message.
857	A well designed suite, extremely comfortable, the bed was excellent, slept well every night.
858	Beautiful hotel, beautiful rooms.
858	Had a really great time and will definitely stay there again!
859	Hotel has great staff,wonderful facilities and the mother lode of things to see and do.
859	Spacious, well appointed rooms.
859	Great location, too.
860	I had a pretty good experience at this hotel.
860	The best thing about my stay was the complimentary valet parking.
860	The service is extremely fast and everyone was nice.
860	I stayed in the king suite.
860	The room was to die for!
860	There is too much to name all the great qualities about the bathroom and room.
860	House cleaning was also great.
860	The only downfalls are that the rooms do not come with DVD players.
860	They have an audio department that charges $95 for a DVD player!
860	That was a total turn off when I can buy a new one for cheaper than that.
860	Also be weary of the frig charges.
860	You will be charged $25/night if you use the frig.
860	They have a system is the frig that measures the weight of anything you place in the frig, that's how they determine if you use the frig.
860	Overall, my stay was pleasant.
860	The hotel is super clean with plenty of places to shop and eat!
860	I won't be staying again though...
861	Beautiful hotel, very clean, okay bed.
861	Only negative is all rooms have terrible water pressure.
862	Definitely a high end hotel on the Strip.
862	A little overwhelming at times.
862	Difficult to chose from all the restaurants.
862	Rooms are wonderful, into evry detail.
863	Hated the music at the pool due to beach club nearby...
863	won't ever stay again!
864	The only thing that really bothered me is the smoking at the swimming pool.
864	You choose a chair to sit down and relax and then somebody sit down next to you smoking.
864	Twice : one as smoking a cigar and the other time smoking a cigarette,Even though the staying was excellent .
864	Service, facilities, gym, food...
864	I do not think I will go back only because of that.
864	Unless things changes...
865	There was a long line at check in, but we were directed to an upper level check in that was much quicker.
865	The room was great, with a separate seating area and a great view.
865	All the hotel workers were very friendly and helpful and we loved the shopping.
865	One caution is that there is a lot of walking to get to your room and to other areas.
865	It wasn't a problem for us, but could be for those who have mobility issues.
866	Flight was cancelled due  to outgoing airport flooding.
866	Venetian charged for room anyway.
868	Great rooms even though we didn't have a great view.
868	At first, it is very confusing getting from one place to another.
869	My wife and I spent the weekend there for a convention .
869	We both loved the amenities and the overall feel of the hotel.
870	Worst experience at a hotel I have ever had.
870	Would not recommend to anyone.
870	Horrible experience with the staff.
871	it was very nice and I would stay there again no problem...
874	Not as good as the encore in class inessential and decor.
875	Wonderful place that I have stayed at every year for years now.
875	However the last couple of stays the friendly service has gone downhill.
875	The front desk seems to be put out if you need anything.
875	When I got there they put me in a different room than what I reserved and when I called about it they were not very pleasant to deal with.
875	Sad that I got this service for all the nights I have stayed with them over the years.
875	Had some friends come in with us and the hotel lost their reservations and the hotel told them too bad.
875	Only thing they had was a suite that was several thousand dollars a night and that is all they could do.
875	Come to find out it was the same room they reserved but now will want 5 times what they had it reserved for.
875	They ended up getting an apartment suite at the Wynn for a 1/3 of what they would have spent.
875	They ran off ppl that would have spent a lot of money at Venetian I guess they just don't care anymore.
876	It was myself, my wife and two teen kids in the one room.
876	The room was great.
876	Two large double beds and a very spacious ""living room"" area, with a second TV and WiFi was FREE.
876	The bathroom was very nice.
876	Two lavatories and a separate makeup area for the teen girl and the toilet was a separate room.
876	A large shower and large tube completed the bathroom.
876	The location was great if you plan to walk Las Vegas Blvd because the Venetian is just about in the center of the strip.
876	I was pleased with the room rate also.
876	We averaged $160 per night.
876	I find the meals are very pricy.
876	One of our breakfasts was $75 and we only ordered for 3, my wife and I split an omelet.
876	There's nearly a dozen restaurants in the hotel as well as the huge mall on the second floor.
876	Gambling was plentiful from penny slots on up there was a slot machine for everyone.
876	There was free entertainment outside in front to the hotel and of course paid entertainment inside.
876	We used the airport shuttle bus so I cannot comment on self parking or valet parking.
877	In general, it is a very nice hotel to stay.
877	However, we did not get room cleaning for 3 days living.
877	but you spent most of time out side of hotel, it did not matter that much.
878	There was dried throw up on the far side of the bed and floor underneath it.
878	My husband and I left a note for the maids to clean it up and they never did.
878	It was disappointing to even know that such a high scale hotel would even rent a room out in that condition.
878	The restaurant choices were for the most part good.
878	The only complaint we have is the Asian noodle restaurant.
878	We had to send back a chicken dish we ordered and refused to pay for it.
878	Whatever came out on the plate was not chicken and it looked absolutely disgusting.
878	Not to mention they had not one employee who spoke English and made it difficult to communicate with them.
879	The Venetian is a beautiful hotel.
879	We stayed in the Venezia section, which was quite a ways from the lobby (two separate elevators).
879	Expect to walk a lot if you stay here...
879	but the beauty of the hotel is worth the walk.
879	Other than that, we loved our room!
879	It was so nice to have a living area with a couch, desk, table and chairs and other side chairs to relax in and not have to always sit on the bed.
879	You wouldn't have to even leave the hotel!
879	The staff was excellent and went above and beyond with anything we asked for or about.
879	We will stay here again in the future.
879	(just hope we get a room a little closer to the front doors.
880	Great Hotel, Had lots of fun, no problems at all, went very smooth!
881	The beds are Not comfortable and they don't clean well the room
882	Room are incredible and big !
883	We loved the Venetian Hotel!
883	Beautiful decor, great food, excellent location on the strip.
883	Three TV's in our suite too.
883	We enjoyed the 2 heated outdoor pools & spas!
883	Three complaints: no in-room coffee machine & no ice in the ice machines?
883	Thirdly, the mini bar contained magnets on the bottom of every item, so when we put our wine & champagne in it to get the bottles cold (there was no ice), we were charged for items that we took out and did not even consume?
884	Location and the quality of the hotel was great.
884	The only inconvenience our group had about the hotel was that there was no lock on restroom door.
884	All the staffs were very alert and friendly, however few of those staffs were misleading and was not very informed about the special membership we signed up for.
884	We were transferred over 5 times to a different information desk to find ourselves back at the lobby where we originally started.
884	Didn't get what was stated in the membership due to complication but the last staff did everything to help us.
884	I'm sure we wouldn't had any problems if we had been informed by a staff that was more knowledgeable about the membership card.
885	Had a great time celebrating my 50th birthday.
885	Staff were great very accommodating in every way.
885	Hotel very well maintained to an excellent standard.
885	Would visit again, highly recommended.
885	very convenient location and genuinely luxurious facilities.
886	Hotel room and facilities were excellent.
886	Friendly and helpful staff.
886	However, due to size of hotel and facilities, navigation through the hallways and elevators was somewhat confusing.
886	Could have used a better and more thorough hotel map, but could not find.
887	I work on the strip and I would recommend the Venetian to anyone coming to las Vegas.
887	The hotel is beautiful and clean the staff are wonderful
888	I enjoyed the overall experience, from the friendly staff, the beautiful pool areas, the shops, gondola ride ( indoor& outdoor), the wonderful restaurants and the beautiful décor.
888	I will never come to Vegas and stay anywhere else.
888	I loved this hotel !
889	everyone was nice and helpful.
892	The staff at front desk very friendly and helpful, the room was lovely, beds were very comfortable.
893	Compared to the one other 5 star hotel in Las Vegas, I was rather disappointed.
893	Maybe it is somewhat expected from a gigantic hotel like that.
893	Staff was friendly enough, but in over all, they lack personal hospitality.
893	Room was nice, but they only gave us one extra blanket when I asked for two.
893	Fridge is all computerized and you cannot even move a bottle in the fridge without getting charged.
893	Bathroom was nice, and it has a TV by the mirror, but the way the bathtub is built, you cannot watch the TV from the bathtub.
895	Big and comfort room,very big hotel.
896	Great experience, good location for dining and shopping
897	This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel, a nd I am just as impressed as the first time.
897	The room ,which are all suites, was beautiful, clean and very spacious.
897	It is close to many things on the strip.
897	The concierge was most helpful in booking our dinners and shows.
897	I will be staying there again on the next trip to Las Vegas.
898	Very nicely appointed room.
898	Plenty of space, nice sunken living room.
898	Beautiful, spacious bathroom.
900	Great location on the strip!
901	It is a very nice hotel.
901	The rooms are gorgeous and very clean.
901	We had a great experience there and it felt like never leaving home in spite of not being from USA.
902	The best hotel I have ever been at!
902	Lot of luxury and a great price per nigth.
902	Actually I have been in a more expensive hotels and the quiality of services, assistance and room of the Venetian is incomparable!
903	excellent facilities, excellent staff, just like Venice but just smaller, we've been to Venice and it's very authentic,excellent restaurants,if you stay here you really don't have to venture outside at all,even the gaming sections are very clean and bright, unlike the other hotels, also kids friendly.
904	From check in - check out perfection.
904	All the employees were helpful and very professional.
904	Worth the money for the comfort and location.
904	I will be staying at the venetian again.
905	Check in was quick and easy.
905	The room was what I expected.
905	The bella suite was more than enough for four people.
905	The restaurants we ate at were great such as Public House and Tao.
905	I would come back again
906	The staff were polite,friendly and courteous,including the casino staff.
906	A slight blip with one of the restaurants but that was corrected.
906	It is extremely hard to find food that is not overloaded with salt.
906	I find this a problem with most eateries particularly in the U.S.-but healthier alternatives should be available in a resort the quality of the Venetian.
906	Overall a satisfactory stay
908	They overbooked our Bella two queen suite and we had to settle for a 1 bed suite.
908	Still paid for the two bedroom.
911	We had a very enjoyable stay at The Venetian.
911	It was beautiful, the gondola ride through the hotel was magical.
914	Although the hotel was very busy, which is expected in Vegas, it was very nice.
914	Pool area was very crowded.
915	I loved my stay @ the Venetian one of the biggest hotels in the world.
915	It's a lot perks to staying @ thus hotel.
915	Such as the club Tao and the beach party.
915	Def would recommend staying there.
915	Only thing was my Internet service was on and off but I wasn't charged for it.
915	GREAT place 2 stay!
916	we could not seem to get a straight answer in regards to renovated rooms in the complex.
916	we were told at check in, some rooms were renovated, we were told the is no full strip view from the complex and than we were than told the renovations of units was just furniture being updated.
916	On checkout we were than told that the entire top half of the building was already renovated (gutted and redone) and that the higher you go the better view of the strip you receive.
916	Could not get a straight answer from anyone as every staff we talked to told us something different.
916	other than that very nice complex.
917	Upon arrival our room was not ready, ended up getting an amazing suite upgrade.
917	Excellent customer service, very elegant.
917	No complaints at all.
917	Beautiful place to stay.
918	The Venetian is a massive hotel.
918	Bigger than Texas with 100 rooms a floor and 40+ floors, it is like a small town all by itself.
918	With such scale, the hotel can't help but come across a bit impersonal and you do feel like just a number.
918	The rooms are large and the king size bed was absolutely brilliant, like sleeping on an air cushion.
918	However, the hotel is starting to date a bit now, with the bathrooms looking a bit tired with fading chrome and dull brass fittings.
918	The pool area was probably the biggest disappointment.
918	It is like a parking lot with vast expanses of concrete, minimal greenery and not a single umbrella.
918	114 Fahrenheit and no umbrellas to shade under?
918	The food in the various hotel restaurants was also generally very average.
918	In fact, a breakfast we had at a little cafe in the Grande Canal area was so bad, we left without eating it.
918	One of the worst meals I have had the displeasure of experiencing.
918	I also ate at the Domencian Restaurant and the food there was also very average and expensive.
918	I think there are better hotels in Vegas at the price.
919	It was a very good stay in Venetian.
919	the rooms are very very spacious and the facilities were top notch.
920	Wonderful location, beautiful hotel...
921	A perfect place for a much needed retreat!
921	NOW THIS REQUIREMENT TO CONTINUE WRITING ABOUT THIS GREAT EXPERIENCE IS MAKING ME REGRET TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
921	Please add a bit more to your review...
921	STOP WITH THIS NONSENSE!
922	Our king suite with a view was outstanding and I would highly recommend the upgrade.
922	The hotel was stunning including the lobby, Grand Canal Shops, casino, restaurants and theaters.
922	There were so many choices and so much to do it was almost overwhelming.
922	I wish the staff would have been more informative about all the hotel had to offer and services provided.
922	We missed eating at Mario Batali's restaurant and would have preferred that over Zeffirino's - just so so.
922	Rock of Ages was great as was The Bourbon Room afterwards.
922	Concierge could have been more helpful too when we went down to pick up our theatre tickets.
922	Overall stay was wonderful !
922	We 'll be back.
923	Simply Wow  but there is no tea or coffee maker in the room and every time you order it takes about 45 minutes and is awfully expensive also and besides this they levy resort charges which are leveied at the time of checkout
924	Overall I had a great experience at the hotel.
924	I would stay their again.
925	Great staff, great food, great hotel.
925	Would recommend to anyone
926	This was our first time staying at the Venetian and it was a great stay.
926	We had stayed at the Pallazo before.
926	But both places are awesome places to stay.
926	The Bella suite was nothing but perfect.
926	I love how the room had two TVs and its own little living area with couch.
927	All rooms are suites excellent for families.
927	Altho a 4000 room hotel, request for services such as extra towels, blanket took only 15 minutes.
927	The grandiour of the hotel is unparallel.
928	A little disappointing that you can not use the mini bar to even store water, that is a real rip off.
928	Rooms are nice but not as clean as you would expect of a 5 star hotel, we found a dusty pair of sunglasses under one bed and what looked like someones skimpy thong behind one of the chairs in the sitting area.
928	Pool was very crowded so we did not even bother to go.
929	They have restaurants from 5 of the top chefs in the world.
929	Only issue is that it is so big.
929	Bring good walking shoes.
929	Probably need to go elsewhere for more entertainment options.
929	But when you come home to your room, you will love it.
929	There is an upscale mall here.
929	Barneys, David Yurman, etc.  The Venice experience of the Gondola rides will be enough to keep you here rather than going to the real Venice.
929	Get a package deal through Expedia and you will save a boatload of money.
929	I went for business and the conference area is incredible.
929	Huge conference stadium and so many breakout rooms.
929	Makes for an incredible experience.
930	We bought our own food and stored it in the in-suite refrigerator not using any of the amenities stored in there, when we went to check out we were charged an extra $105 on top of $65 resort fee (2 nights) just for using their fridge.
931	Service was terrible for a five star hotel.
932	In the past I have stayed at other Vegas hotels but its simply not worth it.
932	The Venetian rooms are opulent and roomy.
932	The hotel is located in the heart of the strip and is a stunning site.
932	Unfortunately this trip the indoor canal was being worked on but they don't deserve to be dinged because they keep up with their hotel.
932	Next time I might try the Palazzo, their sister hotel.
933	good view perfect price，room is very nice。i will be back for pleasure。
934	Returned at 3:30 from the casinos.
934	The room sheets were not changed, carpet was dirty, and shower had hair in it.
934	They sent in a couple maids to correct and are crediting the first night plus room credit.
935	The hotel was great!
935	it's location is great on the strip in the middle of everything.
935	the gotel staff was great and helped with everything we neededthe room was excellent
937	Overall  the hotel is pretty nice, but the pocket door to the bathroom was broken and would not close, also, there is a fake wall between the living room and bedroom, this is not a true suite to me, the powder room in the entry way has a very awkward door to it, it is about 3/4 of the width of the bathroom, and opens inward, you have to almost be a very small child to get to the toilet.
937	The grounds and all of the pools are very nice.
938	We purchased a suite room at venetian from expedia.
938	It was eye catching.
938	But, in reality the location of the room they give you is a nightmare: without a view, hotel key needs to be swiped 10x to be read, obviously stained walls with caulking of faucets so obviously not done right, provides you with few towels, noisy location and has extra fees that they didnt include in the description of what you are paying for
939	Has everything from great shopping, pools and food.
939	Family friendly but also great for couples, or singles.
941	Great trip to Vegas as a relaxing getaway.
941	The Venetian did not disappoint in helping us achieve that.
942	overall great experience and a wonderful time the weather was great
943	First of all, we stayed on a non-smoking floor and yet our room reeked of cigarette smoke.
943	Smoke continued to filter through the vents.
943	In fact, it became so difficult to breathe the hotel had to provide an air purifier.
943	The room itself was worn and unclean, stains on the doors and walls.
943	The couch had cigarette holes also.
943	Definitely not a luxury resort.
943	The casino is very disappointing in its ambience.
943	Definitely not high-class.
943	If you want comfort, class and style, look elsewhere.
944	This hotel has the hottest club TAO, it had a huge mall with all kinds of shops, the casino and the architecture along with the amazing service offered by EVERYONE in that hotel is beyond words.
944	Hotel is located right off the middle of the strip and I highly recommend this hotel.
944	The gym, pool and rooms are huge and well taken care of.
945	First time staying in The Venetian and I was not disappointed.
945	Nice premises and friendly staff.
945	The location is good for the northern part of the Strip; still it's walking distance to most places along the Strip.
945	The Canal shopping mall nice and very convenient for Venetian's guests, it many restaurants, attractions and different convenient and luxury stores.
945	I highly recommend it.
946	My first reservation was at the Palazzo; however, due to overbooking there, we were placed in Venetian.
946	Initially, it was upsetting because we had waited an hour and half  for a room at Palazzo to be cleaned (front desk had said she would have a room cleaned).
946	Requested consideration for the wait and the resort fee was waived.
946	We accepted the room at the Venetian and was delighted when first entering the room.
946	We have stayed at other places in Vegas, but none compare to this hotel...
946	understand Wynn and Encore are luxurious too.
946	We loved the rooms and decor in the suite and the hotel is breathtaking.
946	We ended up staying six nights and paying more than normal because we absolutely loved the place.
946	We had a great time out at the poolside relaxing and meeting new people.
947	It's nice after a crazy, fun-packed day in Las Vegas to have the perfect hotel suite to come home to.
947	Ours was beautiful from end to end, from the panoramic view to the sitting room with its comfortable little sofa; king bed with gorgeous linens, and a bath to die for (massive tub and shower, perfect water pressure, vanity area with a first-rate magnifying mirror, etc.) Service impeccable--no small feat, in that chaotic atmosphere.
947	We enjoyed the casino as well as an excellent and reasonably-priced meal at the Bouchon restaurant.
948	Everything was GREAT...
948	upscale and gorgeous...
948	We were upgraded to a suite...
948	very nice had 3 tvs...
948	.2 flat screens (1 on the wall in front of the 2 queen beds the other was on the wall in the step down living area...
948	and third on wall in bathroom while soaking in the very nice tub!
948	Awesome and very clean ...
948	the beds were so comfy...
948	the Hotel has everything and then some!
948	We loved the Venetian
949	A beautiful hotel with many things to do, and located in the center of the Vegas strip, which is the perfect location for a night in Vegas.
950	We arrived for a wedding and the hotel is very self contained.
950	Entertainment, food, drinks, all were either within the hotel or nearby if one wanted to just walk the strip.
950	The rooms were spacious and comfortable.
952	It was fantastic being able to stay at the Venetian I never thought I would be able to stay there because of the price.
952	Although the bed was not as comfy as I wanted it to be the staff and the hotel was well worth every penny.
952	We had a great time.
954	Our stay was fabulous and we look forward to another visit.
955	Great facilities, clean and up-scale.
955	Good quality bed and beddings, nice spacious room/suite.
956	The reception supervisor (Christopher) was most helpful and went out of his way to be of assistance in a professional and competent manner.
956	A very good start to an enjoyable stay at this hotel.
956	It's the positive attitude of the hotel employees that may be their greatest difference from comparable hotels.
957	A hughe suite staff propose at the registration to upgrade me and i was very satify with it !
958	The hotel is very beautiful, I even think it's more beautiful than Venice.
958	The room was big and comfortable.
958	Their service was very good.
958	I had some medication that needed to store in frig, the room frig was filled up with chargeable items.
958	I called the front desk, and they sent another frig to our room within 20 mins, this is very amazing for a hotel of this size.
959	We have walked through the Venetian and the shops, but this was our first stay.
959	Beautiful hotel and super friendly staff.
959	Rooms are well appointed, bed is comfy although the pillows are a bit too soft for my comfort.
959	All of the restaurants we ate at were great.
959	For how luxurious it feels, it's really well priced.
959	Would stay here again.
960	Comfortable, great room service and very beautiful.
961	We feel comfortable to stay in this hotel.
961	We'll come back next time.
962	We stayed for 2 nights to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary, and got a free room upgrade on check in.
963	beautiful room, great price for a three night stay.
963	you can't beat $440 for flight and hotel
966	Everything was great except I upgraded my room to Bella 2 Queens View Suite but view was really bad.
966	I could not see Vegas strip but roof of a building ( lower level) and some view of pool.
966	I guess we were shopping and sight seeing all day till midnight and did not use the room much except shower and sleep, so upgrading the room to Bella 2 Queens View Suite was waste of the money...
966	If you are planning not to use the room, I would not recommend to upgrade the room to View Suite.
968	The hotel and staff were magnificent.
968	It was enchanting, romantic and full of exciting things to do!
968	A must do in Vegas!
969	This hotel is outstanding great service and clean
970	For the price of the room, I was very disappointed with the hotel.
970	I arrived in the early hours of the morning after my first night booking due to a travel delay.
970	There were 3 front desk staff and maybe one or two people checking in.
970	Nobody called me forward so I went to the desk myself.
970	The lady there gave me only one room key (said system was down) and confirmed that I had a double queen room.
970	She then kind of warned me not to touch anything in the room refrigerator as I would be charged a fee if a beverage was even touched (weight sensitive).
970	However after lugging all our luggage up to the room (long complicated route to room having to change 2 elevators from the parking deck) we discovered that we got a room with a king bed.
970	After calling the front desk again, we were told to wait and somebody would come up with a new key to the right room.
970	We waited another 20 minutes and then made another call for to remind the front desk before we got to the right room after about half an hour after check in!
970	All this after an exhausting 1500 mile drive.
970	The positives were that the room was clean, large and comfortable.
970	Location is also not bad on the strip and the facility is quite beautiful.
970	I feel that I could have gotten more value for my money if I stayed in Hampton inn or Holiday Inn off the strip with far better service (and a free hot breakfast!
971	Upon check-in, the staff were courteous and prompt with everything.
971	I arrived to Las Vegas late but the staff at the front desk checked me in quicker than I anticipated.
971	Also, the representative guided me throughout the hotel and casino and the facility.
971	It was very pleasing.
971	The hotel had more new table games and slot machines.
971	The spa facility is always a favorite.
972	The room is very comfortable and clean.
972	However, we were very annoyed with the refreshment center charges only because we move few bottles around to keep our water bottle cold.
972	We went to the front desk and the rep helped us to eliminate those charges.
972	I think they should redesign the sensor or make the reminding sign more obvious to let the customer understand the charge will appear even if you didn't drink it.
974	No kettle for hot water.
975	The room was beautiful and very spacious!
975	The hotel itself was very nice and the Bouchon restaurant was delicious!
976	Great place to vacation ~ Great atmosphere.
976	I will return sometime soon.
977	Fantastic Hotel to stay at.
977	Very large and very disorientating at times tho.
977	Beautiful and clean rooms.
977	Large variety of restaurants and eating outlets.
977	Pools only average as pool servers at the bar not very friendly, pool scummy and the pool music awful.
978	We stayed here for a bachelorette party and the hotel was beautiful and had very spacious rooms.
978	We typically try new hotels every time we go to Vegas, but I'd absolutely so a repeat at the Venetian.
979	We go to LasVegas every Christmas.
979	The best we have stayed at so far.
980	The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the staff could not have been more pleasant and accommodating.
980	Everyone from the housekeeping staff to the front desk and concierge services was so very helpful and answered our questions with helpful suggestions and tips.
980	The hotel is very central to everything on the strip and we felt that it was really the perfect location.
980	The only thing I would have liked to see was a coffeemaker in the room for that early morning coffee!
981	Venetian staff are extremely accommodating.
981	We arrived very early Thursday and left very late Sunday, and the staff were wonderful with baggage, use of facilities (pools, etc.) and taking care of us on both ends.
982	This hotel is fantastic.
982	The rooms were fabulous, 2 queen beds, huge bathroom, seperate lounge area with corner sofa, desk and small dining table, 3 tvs...
982	The hotel itself is so opulent and luxurious.
982	Was certainly my favourite hotel on the strip!
983	1st room window faced an aircon bank and was very noisy,  was moved to another room but this was just one floor up from the same aircon bank.
983	Had paid a lot of money to stay and was very disappointed with the room and speed of service.
985	PROs:The Venetian allows you to step into a magical world, transferring you to Venice the moment you walk in the door.
985	The lobby areas, grand hallways and beautiful guest rooms all provide grandeur and opulence in a tasteful way.
985	Every detail is well planned, from the automatic light when the closet door opens to the vanity desk and make-up mirror in the bathroom.
985	The blackout curtains did a great job of darkening the guest room.
985	We ate at several restaurants on property and were never disappointed.
985	The service was efficient and friendly and the food at the Grand Lux and Bouchon was delicious, each and every time.
985	Loved the convenience of walking the Grand Canal shoppes and the 38 restaurants on-site.
985	CONs:The hallway noise was a constant problem throughout the night.
985	We actually hoped to get some sleep - probably not the norm when in Vegas.
985	Our room was located next to a long marble hallway.
985	We consistently heard guests laughing and talking as they returned to their rooms.
985	One night we heard a loud, pounding sound for an infinite period.
985	One day our room just didn't get maid service.
985	We were out all day and didn't have a sign on the door - but housekeeping skipped us.
985	Expected better for a hotel of this caliber.
987	You can't help but feel a little daunted when driving through Las Vegas towards a number of massive hotels.
987	However, when we arrived the valet took the car and our bags were taken car of within seconds.
987	A simple check in and we were feet up in a large King Suite with room to swing 2 tigers.
987	My wife and I spent a lot of time around the pool rather than the casino, and we did enjoy a shopping trip and a few meals.
987	The choice of everything in the hotel is mind blowing.
987	A great stay and would come back again no problem.
988	The Hotel was amazing, dining was fabulous.
988	Every time we left the hotel to go to another we found ourselves saying this hotel is not as nice as ours lets go back.
988	The only little complaint was I planned to watch college football on Saturday and NFL on Sunday.
988	There were no any good spots to watch the game.
988	The Sportsbook was full fast, standing room only.
988	The other bars had the games on but could not change the channel to my college team.
988	On Sunday again the Sportsbook was packed and the other bars were showing some games but limited.
988	Not a place to go if you are going to see March Madness.
989	65th birthday celebration ,hotel is one of top in vegas,every thing was top of scale
991	Overall great experience clean and beautiful hotel I love the artwork featured here.
991	Room service was good but very expensive.
992	Best hotel in Las Vegas.
992	Very clean and the staff was very king.
992	The real Italian atmosphere was incredible.
993	This was my third trip to Vegas, I went for my 30th bday with a group of friends and this was by far the best place I stayed (I stayed at the Monte Carlo and Ballys before).
993	We stayed in the Bella suite which was very nice and accommodated the 5 of us comfortably with 2 queen beds and a sofa bed.
993	The only downside was that it seemed like the walk to the rooms was very long, having to take an elevator up to the suites, and then another elevator that took us to our floor.
993	I went to the Tao Beach pool party- it was great, except for the fact that hotel guests still had to pay the cover charge.
993	All of the other pools were free.
993	We had to request housekeeping to come to our room because somehow on the first day they forgot to clean our room.
993	There was a refrigerator in the room that was fully stocked with censored items, so when we removed the items to put our own items into the fridge we were charged until they realized that the original contents were still there (annoying but not a big deal).
993	Overall this hotel is very fabulous and fancy.
993	It has accommodations for families as well as for those that are into the nightlife.
993	It is not located on the busy part of the strip, so if you want to go outside and take a stroll to check out the Vegas scenery its not the best for that, but its not too far.
995	It was a fantastic journey the hotel has a variety of shops and activities it's really unforgettable holiday.
996	Loved seeing faith hill and Tim McGraw
997	We ended up staying in the Palazzo Tower which was beautiful.
997	The room was great with a total of 3 TV's and sitting area.
997	We were on the 47th floor which had a great view.
997	We enjoyed the pool and the entire grounds.
997	There are a million restaurants and shops to choose from.
997	We will look forward to going back just for the room and the food.
998	Our experience was very memorable.
998	We were offered an opportunity to upgrade the suite as well as allowed checking in as soon as we arrived in Las Vegas, about three to four hours prior to the regular checking in time.
998	The tour pick up areas were all clear.
998	Prestige package that we purchased at the checking was attractive, but we did not get full value, given prearranged our full two days of out of town trips.
998	Overall, we are satisfied with the hotel and may try visiting again.
999	problem with housekeeping, hotel quickly rectified with a credit.
1000	Great room, hotel very clean, wish the staff were more friendly.
1001	This hotel lives up to the expectation.
1001	The rooms are huge and have lots of amenities.
1002	excellent area with a variety activities to choose from without ever having to leave the property.
1003	The Venetian is a beautiful hotel.
1003	However, unless you upgrade to a newly remodeled room or above their basic suite, you will find what I call ""faded elegance.
1003	"" The rooms are spacious and nicely arranged but are old and showing it.
1003	The staff is helpful and courteous.
1003	If you are not a smoker, you will smell the smoke as soon as you enter the registration area.
1004	Lovely hotel, staff very polite and helpful, bathroom fabulous with tv, loved the remote control for the blinds and curtains.
1004	Security at all entrances of guest lifts to check your room key so only residents can use pool.
1004	Lovely comfortable bed and pillows and added bonus of bathrobes.
1004	Only downside is the minibar, you can't use it for your own stuff because it is full and if you move anything you will be charged for it, also sweets and drinks in front of tv on a tray and if you move anything you will be charged, bad news if you have children with you.
1004	Overall loved staying here pure luxury.
1005	Beautiful and well maintained.
1005	Only complaint would be the ridiculous mark up on drinks at the pool bar.
1005	I order 2 margaritas for my husband and I (just basic well brand nothing fancy) and the total for 2 drinks was $32.50!
1005	That is just outrageous.
1005	$16.50 each, come on, that is just robbery.
1005	After that, I went to the Walgreens right next to the hotel and got drink to bring into the pool area.
1005	Not sure if we were even allowed but felt justified after getting gouged!
1006	Excellent hotel best in Vegas.
1006	Great to impress a client.
1007	Not the Venetian it used to be that's for sure.
1007	Room didn't even have a coffee pot.
1007	Slots were tight and hotel was empty.
1007	Disappointing, this has always been our favorite hotel on the strip, won't stay there again.
1007	Had to pay a surprise ""time-share"" fee when we checked out and we're not even time-share owners!
1008	Perfect for a couples get away.
1008	Very romantic and luxurious.
1009	Staying at the Venetian was wonderful.
1009	The rooms were large, comfortable and like a home away from home.
1009	The hotel itself is delightful with many levels of shopping and great restaurant choices.
1010	650 sq ft of luxury, 3 tv's, one in the bathroom!
1010	Very clean, a separate living room where you can unwind after a full day, ultimate getaway!
1010	Next time down to Vegas, only the Venetian will do!
1011	Easy walk to other resorts / casinos.
1011	Right on the Strip, yet a little set back from the crowds.
1011	Beautiful decor and facilities in this hotel.
1011	Great pool decks - although pool bar service was a little slow.
1011	Avis car rental desk and cars on the property made it easy to rent a car for the day to drive out to Hoover Dam and Red Canyon - both definitely worth seeing.
1012	We had an amazing stay.
1012	The area is located right downtown and we had plenty of help.
1012	With shopping areas inside we couldn't go wrong.
1012	The only issue I had was upon checkout when a few had picked up items off of the sensor bar which automatically charged us.
1012	However the staff took those charges off after we told them no item was eaten or used.
1012	All in all I will definitely return again.
1013	Great experience; however, it is a little annoying trying everything that you can not to tip over anything on the pressure sensitive snack tray.
1013	With the money that you spend for this kind of room, put that type of stuff in a locked cabinet and assigned key.
1013	I shouldn't have to watch everything that I do just to make sure I don't bump into that silly thing.
1017	If you are looking for a truly personal experience, skip the Venetian.
1017	With 4000 rooms and the facility being a large as a small town, personalized service is hard to come by.
1017	I've stayed here twice for work events and it's beautiful and impressive and enormous and bustling with activity 24/7.
1017	Arriving very late Sunday evening after a very long flight from the east coast, i was disappointed to find the front desk area closed for a photo shoot and had to wait in a long, roped-off line to be shuffled to a back room where a makeshift check-in was set up.
1017	After that ordeal, everything was fine.
1017	The place is SO big that it takes time to get acclimated and easy to get lost.
1017	Lots of food options and the room was great - the best hotel bed I've ever slept in.
1018	This hotel is one of the best in Vegas.
1018	The room was pretty spacious and really luxurious.
1018	The staff was friendly.
1018	The pool areas are really really nice.
1018	Therefore, we would recommend this hotel.
1018	However, if you make comparisons this hotel is not as happening as the Bellagio or the Wynn hotels.
1018	Also, the Bellagio and Wynn hotels are newer than the Venetian so we would stay in either of the two on our next visit.
1019	Overall very good but if only you provide coffee maker and microwaves in the room then I won't bother staying anywhere else.
1020	A little glitch with our room but it was resolved.
1021	The stay at the Venetian was incredible.
1021	We loved everything about the hotel and the restaurants within it.
1021	I would stay again if given the opportunity.
1023	Excellent experience,  feel in love with the room, casino and service.
1024	I've travelled to Las Vegas a bit in the past, and really found that this hotel was well organized and had great attention to detail.
1024	From being welcomed when we arrived, to having a great room, the experience was fabulous.
1025	The Venitian never disappoints!
1025	Everything was just perfect.
1025	Loved the Bella Suite!
1027	The suite was spacious and had the added bonus of having a printer/fax right in the room, which was great for printing confirmations for shows, rental cars and airline boarding passes.
1027	Room service food was exceptional.
1027	The staff at the concierge desk were helpful and attentive.
1027	Overall we had a very good experience at the Venetian.
1030	My boyfriend and I have always stayed at The Palazzo in Vegas and we absolutely love it!
1030	So we thought we would try and stay somewhere different so we tried The Venetian.
1030	They are connected so we thought that it would be identical.
1030	Although, the hotel is very similar, there were a few differences that I didn't like.
1030	First off, I think the Valet in the Palazzo is easier to access.
1030	Secondly, I think entering into the hotel from the casinos is a TON easier into the Palazzo.
1030	The Venetian has so many different ways to enter, due to them having two towers.
1030	Lastly, the housekeeping staff in the Palazzo was top notch.
1030	Our housekeeper didn't put away the blow dryer every day, the ironing board was never put away and my make up was never picked up and put on the ledge in a nice manner.
1030	The Palazzo is first class and they really spoil you there.
1030	I will always stay at The Palazzo, never at The Venetian again.
1031	Overall this is a great hotel and one of the best places to stay in Vegas.
1032	The hotel is beautiful.
1032	The suites were so nice.
1032	You could relax and not be on top of each other.
1032	The employees were very frendly.
1033	Great room but only complaint that i have are towels...
1033	i expected more from a 4 or 5 star hotel.
1034	It was its own city, it was so big.
1035	A lovely way to celebrate the births of 2 dear friends!
1035	We loved the location and luxury of the Venetian.
1035	Good food, comfy beds, spacious room.
1035	A nice treat to see the taping of Wheel of Fortune!
1035	Casino - we were all winners!
1035	LOVED the indoor canals...
1036	Pros: Superb 'central' location.
1036	Stunning architecture and decor.
1036	Cons: The WiFi was often down / unreliable - If something is broken or being upgraded - tell us and make some alternative arrangements.
1037	Nice hotel, nice rooms.
1037	The only thing is on top of prepaid package they charge 28$ USD as a resort fee per day, which was a surprise for us.
1037	We thought everything was included in the package
1038	I was there for 8 days and it was great!
1038	I truly enjoyed the entire resort and all it had to offer.
1039	This is the third time I have stayed in this hotel.
1039	That itself should say a lot.
1039	Right from check-in to check-out, te staff is fabulous and very gracious.
1039	Love the suite style bedrooms,  especially the step down living room with its own TV.
1039	Rooms and bathrooms are spacious.
1039	Only gripe is NO coffee maker in the room, and room service for a pot of tea/coffee is ~$ 25/- .
1039	Overall fantastic stay and only hope they do provide in room coffee maker!
1039	Also, do not touch anything in the mini bar and the tray of goodies near the TV!
1039	They move and you get charged!
1039	Luckily I checked my bill while checking out and realized my folly!
1039	Mentioned it to the check out staff, and they graciously removed the charges.
1039	Happy vacation y'all :-)
1040	The hotel smelled very smokey from cigarettes.
1040	Need a better air filtration if possible.
1040	For those who are not used to being around smoke often as it is banned in most indoor California places, it is hard to gamble or hang out inside for the evening.
1040	Went to encore and Wynn where air quality is better.
1040	We ate snacks at the Gran Luxe after 2am and the service was very not very good.
1042	We were originally reserved with the Bella suite.
1042	At checkin they gave us an upgrade for an additional $50 per night.
1042	For the money, size and architectural quality of the suite.
1042	The couch was in poor repair.
1042	Looked worn and used, missing buttons.
1042	There were no drawers to store clothing.
1042	the towls were small, flat and rough.
1043	great trip that started with the Venetian,excellent restaurants & great shows
1045	Spent one night at the Venitian in November.
1045	The room was great, the staff was friendly.
1045	Over all it was a nice experience
1046	The Venetian was the highlight of Vegas for us, together with the helicopter ride into the canyon.
1047	I got lost a couple of times.
1047	The pickup was in the backside of the hotel, so I almost lost my helicopter- flight.
1051	Fantastic hotel (small city really) right in the middle of the biggest and the best.
1051	Really good staff, clean as a whistle, room really quiet, just doesn't get much better.
1052	The king size room was great, the beg was very comfortable, 3 TV / one 60 inch in the bedroom area and the other In the family room area small one in the bathroom, oh I would not stay anywhere else
1053	overall it was a nice hotel.
1053	I only wish there is coffee maker in the room, at least I can have a cup of tea.
1053	the resort fee is a total waste.
1054	We booked this hotel to celebrate my 60th birthday.
1054	I was completely surprised at how comfortable, elegant, and friendly it was.
1054	I would go back in a heartbeat!
1055	This is a nice hotel & casino & restaurants & swimming pools.
1056	Just wanted to say my wife loved the layout of the Hotel.
1056	We had such a good time.
1058	Everything in this hotel is amazing.
1058	Right in the heart of everything, great location
1060	Stayed just one night and everything was quite nice and clean.
1060	I stayed in the lowest suite but it was quite roomy with 3 televisions, a sitting area, and bed area.
1060	Would recommend if the sale is right!
1061	The Venetian was wonderful.
1061	Absolutely first-class resort with a well-kept gambling floor, an amazing array of shops and restaurants, and friendly staff!
1061	We stayed here between Christmas and New Years, and it was a great time.
1061	Delmonico steak was incredible!
1062	First time in Vegas and it was fab...
1062	The Venetian is stunning, very clean, smells lovely (im sure they put scent into the air conditioning...
1062	) we had a problem with the wifi in that we could not connect to it...
1062	and the maid was knocking on our door at 8.30AM offering room service...
1062	we had our 2 children with us and after being out the night before ended up with 2 tired children from being woken so early...
1062	we complained to the front desk and they removed the resort fee from our bill...
1062	we wernt used to staying in such a big hotel...
1062	apart from the reception staff we had no contact with any hotel staff...
1062	but it was a lovely hotel, we had a bella suite which was very nice and very comfortable!
1063	This was my first visit to Vegas, but my husband has been several times.
1063	Like other reviews, they offered us a room upgrade for an additional $50 a day - worth the $ spent.
1063	The hotel is beautiful, but you can get lost easily.
1063	I have no idea what benefit we received for the $28 a day resort fee though.
1063	For the price we paid for the room, it was disappointing that there was no mini-refrigerator or coffee maker.
1063	It would have been nice if there was at least a credit for a small cup of coffee each day.
1063	The most unfriendly, rude casino staff out of all the casinos we visited.
1063	Grazie rewards points are a joke, especially considering how much money we spent at the hotel and casino.
1063	Customer service and room cleanliness lacking.
1063	We got a stained, dirty towel one day.
1063	No shower mat or hand towel another day.
1063	They rinsed out the used glasses and replaced them as if they were clean - my lipstick was still on the glass.
1063	If you plan on renting a car, get it from the airport - you will save a fortune.
1063	Make sure you check your bill closely for charges.
1063	We were charged $9 for M&Ms that we didn't eat.
1063	Noticed it on the bill once we left - after calling the hotel, they credited it back to our card.
1063	On a positive note, the room and view were beautiful.
1063	Loved the remote control blinds and curtains.
1063	Agree with other reviewer that the lights in bathroom were not very bright - likely due to high efficiency bulbs they use.
1063	Many great restaurants in the hotel!
1064	This hotel is absolutely beautiful it has everything that you need and the proximity to everything is so close, I recommend this hotel highly!
1065	I had dinner at The Venetian on a business trip back in January and I knew instantly this is where I wanted to go for our anniversary trip.
1065	I highly recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone.
1065	It is worth every penny - from the moment you arrive, you feel like royalty.
1065	It is a huge hotel, so be prepared to walk.
1065	It is right in the heart of everything.
1065	So much to see and do...
1065	I can't think of anything bad about this hotel.
1065	Can't wait to visit again.
1066	The room we stayed in was beautiful.
1066	Very clean with ample space.
1066	The only minor inconvience was not being able to adjust the temperature of the room any colder than was set.
1066	The thermostat didn't allow for it.
1066	We couldn't get the room cooler than about 70 degrees so if you like to sleep cool, you might discuss this with hotel personnel.
1066	We just dealt with it.
1066	That being said, the hotel and staff were wonderful and I will absolutely stay there again.
1067	Walk to Tower rooms a little confusing at first but after the 3rd day, it was ok.
1067	Bouchon restaurant too expensive for the quality of the food.
1067	Canyon Ranch is hard to find and prices exceed those of other CR locations I've visited.
1068	Just back from Vegas absolutely fabulous hotel out of this world
1069	The Venetian was very nice.
1069	We were upgraded to the Hospitality suite which was roughly 1500 sq ft.
1069	with a private bedroom and living room, two baths, and everything was remote including the drapes.
1069	The staff was great and worked with us because I saw that the Venetian was offering a promotion for spa services if you booked through them and I had booked through Expedia.
1069	This is the reason they upgraded us.
1069	The hotel was very clean and even though smoking, you could barely tell so they keep the air very clean.
1069	I could barely find any cigarette burns or evidence that folks were smoking.
1069	I was a little disappointed in the room that they told me was just remodeled.
1069	A lot of guests were having trouble opening their doors because none of the fixed features (like doors) were upgraded so there was one point when there were 4 of us in the hall trying to open our doors unsuccessfully.
1069	This was our first trip to Vegas and I would definitely go back to the Venetian.
1070	I enjoyed having a suite.
1070	It was nice to come back in the evening and relax in the living room in a fluffy bathrobe that was provided.
1071	Hotel and the amenities are outstanding, however, the restaurants are not what I would call value received.
1071	For the prices the restaurants charge the meals should be superb, at best they are so-so.
1073	We had a great time.
1073	The hotel was fabulous, shows were great, everything was great.
1074	Have a many store.
1074	The hotel have a restaueanr
1075	Cleanliness unbelievable, great staff, good comfortable rooms and decorations, brilliant experience, trouble free, look forward to going again
1076	One of the best on the strip, any bad reviews of this place I'm guessing are just whining, this place would be hard to beat!
1076	Not cheap but worth the money if you like luxury
1078	We came to the Venetian with high hopes.
1078	We were a group of 5 couples in town to celebrate two 50th birthdays.
1078	The suites are lovely but the sheets smelled old even when replaced and some days housekeeping only left us with one towel.
1078	Dirty room service trays sat in the hall for hours.
1078	When you call the front desk you get a recorded message.
1078	Then things got worse.
1078	The ten of us had booked a special $2000 dinner and nightclub package at Tao which included a set menu and then a private table in the nightclub with Grey Goose bottle service.
1078	We did this package last year and it was fun but this time we were seated in a tiny booth with room for 6 and it was right next to a garbage can.
1078	When we complained we were offered a booth for 10 out in the hallway away from the actual club.
1078	When the bottle service came it was Absolut.
1078	But the main problem with our Tao package was the lack of service when we had the seating problem.
1078	We spent a total of one hour and 15 minutes talking to various staff members and none of them helped.
1078	We eventually just walked out without dancing or drinking anything.
1078	The birthday party was spoiled by the poor service and we were told the Tao manager would contact us to discuss a partial refund and we're still waiting four days later with no word from anyone.
1078	We have stayed at many 5 star properties around the world and the Venetian is definitely the worst.
1078	It's a beautiful facility but it's not backed up by great service.
1079	Mynhusband and I celebrated our 21st anniversary in Vegas.
1079	Our stay was nice and the service was great.
1079	All personnel were friendly and helpful.
1080	Room was not cleaned , we found food from the previous guests in the refrigerator,
1081	LOVED the Venetian - and they upgraded us - just because.
1081	We stayed with our 2 boys aged 10 and 11 and we had so much room and luxury!
1082	Overall experience was very good but disappointed on two accounts - no coffee / tea maker in the room and no complimentary drinking water .
1082	You need to take even water  from the mini bar at exorbitant price .
1082	I would also suggest that breakfast should also be complimentary so as to make "" search ""  the breakfast - first thing in the morning ,one does not appreciate .
1083	checking in was a breeze we were on our way to the room within minutes.
1083	finding the elevators took a few minutes and of course you have to walk through the casino.
1083	the room itself was impeccably clean and the beds were dreamy.
1083	cant remember last time i had such a good sleep in a hotel.
1083	highly recommended this place is immaculate and they keep it squeaky clean at all times
1084	It was so beautiful!
1084	the grand hallway was amazing!
1085	If you spend much time in your room, this hotel is a great choice.
1085	Its room is quite big and well-furnished as described.
1085	The bed is comfortable and bathroom is amazing.
1085	The pool is also good.
1085	However, if you are a big fan of gambling, this hotel is not the best choice.
1085	Casino place is little smaller than other big hotels like Bellagio.
1086	We stayed here for 5 nights.
1086	the bed was very uncomfortable so unlike the fluffy comfy bed u usually get at a hotel.
1086	the room was spacious and so was the bathroom.
1086	nothing to watch on the tv u even have to pay for music.
1086	u cant move anythng in the fridge or u'l get charged for it which sucks coz we couldnt cool our water bottles.
1086	and it was a rly long walk to get to the room.
1086	very annoying if ur wearing heals.
1086	the grand canal shoppes were beautifully designed lots of shops and dining options feels like ur in Venice indeed.
1086	We dined in Cut, Bouchon, Carlo's bakery, Morels, Grand Lux Cafe and ingeneral i would suggest Grand Lux for breakfast their portions are huge though and Cut(wolfgang puck) was just out of this world kind of steak!
1086	we didnt gamble much in the Venetian Casino because most of the rules and limits are in the casinos favor.
1086	i prefered the Palazzo and the Wynn.
1086	All in all Hotel is magnificent.
1086	and we've seen all the other hotels and we were so happy with our pick.
1086	dont hesitate to stay here.
1086	and the gondola rides is a must try to they sing for you and you really feel good after it.
1088	The all-suite layout of the hotel rooms is a real plus.
1088	They are spacious, quiet, nicely adorned, comfortable and modern.
1088	The bathrooms are large, clean and nicely organized.
1088	This is a favorite hotel spot here in Las Vegas!
1089	Great hotel, large room, comfortable service, various choices of shopping, dining and other entertainment, however, not very expensive at all especially on weekdays, strongly recommended !
1090	We stayed in a King suite which I discovered is the minimum luxury level there.
1090	Baggage delivery was very efficient given the expanse of the hotel.
1090	Lots of celebrity chef restaurants to wet your appetite and regular fast foods as well to help stretch your dollar.
1090	Loved that the Fashion Show mall was within walking distace.
1092	One of the best hotels I stayed.
1093	Scheduling in suite room service at this hotel was like pulling teeth.
1093	Also when the food finally arrived it was the wrong order and was burnt.
1093	I would recommend the rest of the hotel however.
1094	No problems with room.
1096	Great stay, wish the room was refreshed a bit better, always smelled a bit stale.
1096	Our view was of the impending Ferris wheel...
1096	Should be quite a site for this hotel views once it is completed.
1096	You have to love vegas, the biggest playground in the world :)
1097	My wife and I spent our 20th anniversary at the Venetian.
1097	We loved our room...
1097	very luxurious with view of mountains and pool.
1097	Huge mall on the second floor with everything you need.
1097	Lots of restaurants on the premises as well as a food court for quick snacks.
1097	Three theatres connected to the hotel.
1097	Pools were great but if you have to go early to get chairs.
1097	We usually had to wait for chairs later in the day.
1097	The concierge service was useless as there was always a long line up.
1097	However, calling the operator on the phone from our room was very handy...
1097	could usually answer all of our questions.
1098	Beautiful hotel but a far walking distance to most shows that we saw.
1100	For a luxury hotel, it did not live upto expectations.
1100	Room and bathroom was not clean when checked in, bath tub was particularly dirty.
1100	No extra soap in the room, ran out.
1100	temperature control was not working, the room was cold at night.
1100	No ROBE in the room.
1100	Pools were so crowded there was no room to sit or swim.
1100	Operators always busy, had to listen to 2 commercials before someone would answer.
1100	Room service did not show up till almost 5 pm.
1100	Overall, disappointing for such an expensive trip.
1100	Service desk had attitude.
1101	Out of this world hotel stay :-) An amazing resort, Wifi connection was disappointing but the Venetian staff were very quick in responding to the issue.
1101	Strongly recommend a visit to this resort.
1102	Upon check in, the staff was accommodating, as I was trying to get 2 rooms near each other.
1102	We were given rooms on the 8th floor with absolutely no view except the roof top.
1102	My room was nice but disappointing, when I went to check the view, I found my sheer curtain was stained with something red I didn't want to imagine what.
1102	Unusual for me, I returned to check in and asked for different rooms.
1102	They moved us up to the 28th floor, with a similar but much better view, as I could at least see the city and mountains in the distance.
1102	This I was very happy about.
1102	The room was luxurious, and large.
1102	The hotel itself was ok, dining options moderate and bar options, minimal.
1102	I have stayed at other luxury casinos on the strip and will definitely stay elsewhere.
1102	The pool area was very nice altho very crowded, with one area of the main pool having something very nasty floating near the walk in stairs.
1102	Loved the shallow pool until the kids showed up.
1103	Nice place in Las Vegas, love the second floor, it's a good place to stay and shop.
1103	No buffet in here is not ideally convient.
1104	Exceptional hotel with excellent staff.
1104	Very, very clean.
1104	Very roomy and homey.
1104	Gondola ride was fun, but a bit overpriced for 10 minutes.
1104	You can go between the Venitian and the Palazzo pools which was very nice for options.
1104	Shops are very high end.
1107	very sarcastic employees do not order from the café service is non existant if you order food while playing in the casino I was hypoglycemic and needed an orange juice or soup asap a houseman had a waiter brought to my table immediately.
1107	the waiter kept insisting I give him my loyalty card.
1107	22 minutes later I left having never seen my waiter or loyalty card again.
1107	I went up to a another houseman to complain saying I was a guest of the venetian and was there to play in the casino.
1107	his comment to me was Arent you the lucky one.
1107	BRET in the poker room was his name I stayed in my room the rest of the week but traveled elsewhere to eat or gamble.
1107	my last stay ever at venetian.
1107	after 36 trips to vegas it was my worst stay ever and I even won.
1108	This was a very nice place and it was very affortable.
1110	Room service staff was very friendly as well as everyone else in the hotel.
1110	Even helpful when I called back after out stay to find out what kind of mattress we slept on!
1111	I understood why everyone want to stay in Venetian Hotel.
1111	It was an awesome experience.
1112	Overall very good , but problems occurred with delayed check out system I paid $110 extra to extend check out time to 6pm and all my entry keys were disabled at around 5 pm all my luggage was stuck in the room , quite a hassle to get resolved.
1113	The husband and I booked this hotel due to the awesome deal we received through Expedia!
1113	We would pay full price for this hotel in the future & I've already told everyone I know how enjoyable and great our stay was.
1113	There were the same type of slots throughout the hotel, though, and the floor was jam packed with machines.
1113	We ate in the restaurant with two for less than $40...
1113	That's unheard of!
1113	We also enjoyed the Rock of Ages show & it was GREAT!
1113	Worth the money to get in the 3-4 row...
1114	Middle of the strip, good views, luxurious accommodations.
1114	We've stayed at MGM and this was by far better!
1116	Super big, clean and all around wonderful rooms.
1116	This was the first time I actually took advantage of the amenities at a hotel in Vegas.
1116	Great pools, restaurants, etc. Highly recommend breakfast at Morels.
1117	There is no where to sit snd have a relaxing drink.
1117	It is a long haul to get to the street .
1117	Rooms are beautiful but.
1118	nice beds I got a suite but the view was nonexistent...
1119	We went for a family vacation to visit Vegas and Gran Canyon.
1119	We had 9 yr child with us.
1119	Excellent hotel, very family friendly and very specious room.
1119	Very helpful front desk people.
1121	We celebrated our 25 wedding anniversary in Vegas!
1121	the Venetian is a great place to stay.
1121	The Casino has great beverage service ,house keeping is very good and friendly.
1121	Everyone we met was very helpful.
1121	This was our first time in Vegas and I can not wait to go back!
1122	Not a single issue the whole 8 days we were there.
1122	This was a true 5 star experience with an exceptional location.
1123	Everyone from check-in people to maid service was always smiling and ready to help me in anyway I needed.
1124	This was my first visit to vegas.
1124	Stayed in the Venetian tower.
1124	The suite had no view.
1124	The food court and the Asian food place is not that good.
1124	Lux cafe restaurant had very good food.
1124	Tao beach pool party was the best experience of my trip.
1124	Since Venetian is on the strip, it is super convenient.
1125	From the hotel to the service.
1126	I visited this hotel twice in the same week because one night I went to Grand Canyon.
1126	The lady who help us with the check in was nice but she doesn't speak Spanish, I request somebody but no one speak this language, it was for me a little difficult understand her.
1126	The room was beautiful and big, no complementary coffee, water or tee, it was late and the coffee shop was closed.
1126	The second time they change the building, the view was horrible!
1126	, they told me that if I was change to other view the cost will be $75.00 by night but because I make the reservation by Expedia I couldn't change the room for other with better view, so, my curtains always were close.
1126	This is not the first time that if I want to change something in any hotel or car rental I can't change nothing because I use an Internet site, they argument is that if I make the reservation directly I can change all but with intermediaries is impossible make nothing
1127	Great location, staff and ambiance.
1128	I live 90 miles from Atlantic City yet travel across the country to LVNo comparison.
1129	The restaurant was marvelous the few days we stayed there everyone of the restaurant we tried was good and service was great .
1129	I would think twice about the sushi samba though.
1129	Over price service was slow so not worth the money .
1129	I was disappointed in the pool.
1129	It was very dirty swamp looking near the step of the pool in the water .
1129	Look like somebody drink or puke in it .
1129	But the filter and worker didn't clean it.
1129	Mgm pool is way better .
1129	Drink service at the casino floor was horrible even though they had a button service half of it didn't work .
1129	The waitress was rude even though I tip 2 to 3 dollar per drinks.
1129	The dealer at the table was rude they expect tip even though you are losing all night long .
1129	Finally I hit a few hundred at the 3 card poker table but still in the hole I tip 10$ bucks but she still made a smart comment about me tipping less.
1129	Which was very rude .
1129	But over it was my first time stayed there .
1129	I will definitely be back for the restaurant but probably not be a guest there.
1130	Great location with elevators fairly close to reception, unlike other hotels.
1130	Large room overlooking the pool.
1130	Pool and facilities were top class.
1130	Nice breakfast and lunch menus at a Grand Luxe Cafe.
1131	The room was real nice and good value for the size and free breakfast.
1132	There was a piece (about 1 1/2 inches) of the marble counter chipped off right at the basin area in the bathroom, the piece that was chipped off was sitting on the counter.
1132	The front door lock had a loose screw that kept falling out.
1132	When the screw was off, you couldn't open the front door from the inside of the room.
1132	I didn't have anything to tighten the screw with, so I just had to hold it tightly again the door with one hand and try and pull the door open with the other.
1132	I didn't bother to call since we were getting ready to leave (only stood one night).
1133	A wonderful get away destination for an anniversary.
1134	During check-in at the Venetian, I asked for a late check-out because our flight was at 7:00pm.
1134	Because of high volume at the Venetian, they switched us to the Palazzo to accommodate our request.
1134	It was a great switch.
1134	The room at the Palazzo was huge, clean, comfy beds, great cleaning staff, not crowded, wonderful restaurants and you could walk to the Venetain either through the pool areas or indoors.
1134	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and did recommend it to other people who asked us about the hotel.
1135	This gigantic resort is just a little bit too stressful for a restful vacation.
1135	Prior to arrival, they promised me the option of a single modest deposit on my debit card to cover the seven day stay, as long as I agreed not to charge anything to the room.
1135	But that's not what happened.
1135	Instead, they charged the initial modest deposit plus a $25 per day resort fee (which I had also agreed to) but then the next day, another $196 pre-authorization appeared on my debit card.
1135	And then the next day, ANOTHER $196 pre-authorization appeared.
1135	When I went downstairs to the front desk to complain, they insisted that they had not placed the other two pre-authorizations on my card.
1135	My bank stated otherwise.
1135	Then there is the walkway you have to negotiate to get to your room.
1135	All Las Vegas hotels on the strip make you pass the casino.
1135	But the Venetian's walk way is very narrow and overcrowded.
1135	People walk on the wrong side and stop for absolutely no reason.
1135	You don't find out until you've been there awhile that there are other ways of getting to the room.
1135	The casino is one of the busiest and noisiest in Vegas.
1136	Grand Lux Cafe was by far the best place to eat for the money.
1136	Very good security to rooms and to the pool.
1136	Pool was very crowded and not ""old people"" friendly!
1136	The ""honor bar"" included items that, once you picked them up to look at them, you were automatically charged due to a sensor going off.
1136	There should be more obvious notice about that feature.
1136	Loved the robes and bathroom.
1136	More lighting was needed in the suite.
1136	Overall a lovely place but unless you have big $$$, go somewhere else to gamble.
1138	Always wanted to experience Vegas.
1138	Staying at the Venetian was a good choice.
1138	It connects to the Palazzo with beautiful shops and awesome restaurants on the 2nd floor.
1138	**Buddy V's and Carlo's Bakery were awesome.
1139	I reserved three king sized bed with view room on expedia, however only one of them is qualified as 'view room'.
1139	The rest two rooms are not, and they don't even have options for us to choose when I checked in at 10:00 am.
1139	They told us they only have three rooms left so there is nothing for them to help us to get a 'view room'.
1139	I am not sure whether they just want to give us a tough try or not.
1140	Great ubication, excellent room.
1141	Enjoyed every moment, very relaxing spa experience was amazing very friendly staff,
1143	There seemed to be a bit of communication breakdown when it came to relations between the front desk and the rest of the staff.
1143	We arrived late evening on Tuesday and crashed for the night.
1143	Upon waking the next morning we explored the room a little more, opening the minibar to find a bag of rotten food of some sort allowing the aroma of garbage to permeate the room.
1143	It was addressed with the front desk immediately that morning and we returned to our suite midafternoon to find it was still present in the fridge and the smell was getting worse.
1143	I walked into the hall with the bag of rotten food and simply gave it to the housekeeper in the hallway and requested to the front desk a second time for the fridge to be cleaned.
1143	(I did however state that the bag had already been removed and we were storing a different box of macrons my brother had brought into town in the fridge).
1143	When we returned to the room that night we found the fridge had been cleaned, but the box of macrons had also been removed.
1143	In addition to that, on our first night in the hotel we had purchased a bottle of wine to celebrate our arrival.
1143	The corkscrew broke almost immediately when we attempted to open said wine and when we addressed that issue with the front desk, the staff replaced our corkscrew with a bottle opener.
1143	When THAT was addressed with the front desk, a replacement corkscrew was promised to the room, yet over the next two days, we'd never see that corkscrew.
1143	Other than that - good stay!
1144	When you check in to this beautiful hotel, you will be greeted with ""can I have your ID and credit card"".
1144	You not be welcomed at all.
1144	The hotel is very pretty, but do not stay there is you are used to service.
1144	It also took us 8 minutes to walk from the front desk to our room.
1145	We had a double Queen Suite that was perfect for three women sharing the space.
1145	The suite was rather large, 700 square feet by description but it felt so pleasant as their was the bedroom area and a living room area with a fold out couch so we all actually had our own sleeping areas.
1145	The Bathroom was very large and accommodating.
1145	We had a great experience.
1146	check in was efficient.
1146	Hotel cleanliness was excellent.
1146	Value for money with room was good and amenities in hotel were good also.
1146	The vast size of hotel caused some issues in regards locating particular venues.
1146	Signage is present but not always easy to follow.
1146	Security was exceptional with entry to floor levels managed.
1146	All staff helpful and very pleasant.
1146	Would recommend this hotel...
1146	everything we wanted was available and the central location helped with outings.
1147	Our stay was great.
1147	The staff was friendly.
1147	The hotel is beautiful.
1148	very nice rooms, loved having that tv while soaking in the tub.
1148	Casino was smokier than I expected.
1148	Restaurants had excellent variety.
1149	Perfect, perfect & perfect.
1149	Love the room (upgraded suite), love the place and surroundings, great service and hospitability.
1149	Nice and warm staff at valet and bell boys.
1149	Simply the best we ever tried - we will indeed come back and recommend to everybody.
1150	As perfect as can be!
1150	Bus line runs out front.
1150	Great in-house restaurants and fresh squeezed orange juice in Cafe Lux.
1153	We love to stay here, it's in the middle of everything!
1154	Venetian Resort was nice, standard suite had low wattage light bulbs even when all lights were on it was still too dim.
1154	Had power outage and had to be moved to another suite - upgraded lighting fine.
1154	Getting the relocation suite was very frustrating and time comsuming, no staff communication.
1155	The smoke smell in the casino and hallways was overwhelming at the Venetian.
1155	We walked many other hotels and the smell was not as bad.
1155	There could have been a faulty system while we were there I hope that'sThe case.
1155	The restaurants were awesome the stores were awesome.
1155	The suite was very comfortable and the view we had was absolutely gorgeous.
1156	I loved the Venetian!
1156	Great place to stay!
1156	Everything was clean and ready when we arrived.
1157	We had a wonderful time, great location, and a wonderful hotel.
1158	Excellent hotel and awesome experience!
1158	Would stay again and recommend to anyone.
1159	The Venetian is amazingly beautiful.
1159	We barely left as there was so much to do within the Venetians own walls.
1159	The only downfall was when I booked this room the pictures of the bathroom with a Roman tub is what got me to book there.
1159	We are bubble bath buffs and being our first time in Vegas I wanted it to be perfect for me and my boyfriend.
1159	The tub was a large standard tub.
1159	Nothing like the picture showed so disappointing.
1159	The bed was very comfortable which was nice for the late sleep in mornings there.
1159	We did not know there was an option for a smoking room until we heard someone being asked if which they preferred.
1159	My boyfriend smokes and went downstairs each time when he felt like a cigarette.
1159	We would have paid a little more if needed to save all the trips out of the room.
1160	This resort is amazing, I found the level of service awesome, very friendly staff, noticeable is how well kept are the grounds surrounding the hotel and your room, the atmosphere is very european.
1160	Its definitely a resort geared to a mature crowd.
1161	We always go here because there is great food, and always something to do.
1163	Excellent size and very quiet.
1163	Pour refrigerator wasn't cold and it was $16 for an 8oz Strawberry Daquari with 1/2 oz shot of Bacardi in it, at the pool lol Outrageous!
1163	But,  that's the only negative thing I can say :)
1165	Our stay at the Venetian was excellent.
1165	The room, the view, the staff, the amenities were top-notch.
1165	My only comment would be that the hotel is so large that you tend to get lost.
1165	Be sure to wear comfortable shoes because the amount of walking you have to do to get from anywhere in the hotel/casino back to your room is not for weak ankles in high heels.
1165	You will walk miles from the elevator to your room and back to the elevator.
1165	Even so, it is a totally high class Suite  Hotel!
1166	Rooms where above expectations.
1171	Had a great time.
1171	Very comfortable beds, great restaurants, and very clean.
1172	When you enter the resort you are greeted with a friendly staff a luxurious room and an awesome experience!
1172	I recommend to anyone looking for the Vegas experience!
1175	I stayed for 3 days and 2 nights.
1175	Our rooms were clean and spacious.
1175	The hotel itself is very nice and employees are very helpful.
1175	I would stay here again.
1177	We requested a room with a view at check in and the girl at the front desk (I think her name was Courtney) gave us a room with a view of the pool and mountains!
1177	During the day you can hear the music from Tao beach which made it feel like we were on an island vacation.
1177	The hotel had everything great food, amazing shopping and it feels really safe because security checks the guest in and out of the living areas.
1178	Rooms were nice size.
1178	Although, the furniture could use an update or a good cleaning (sitting area/couch).
1178	Plenty of dining options and close to casino and shopping.
1178	Pool area was a big bummer.
1178	The pool area got limited hours of direct sun.
1178	Even for a nice/warm day in October it was kinda chilly in the shade at the pool.
1178	The pool staff was awful.
1178	A waitress passing by me, spilled a drink from her tray on me and my chair and clothes.
1178	She barely apologized and didn't come back to clean up the mess.
1178	At the least, I thought I deserved a comp drink or offer to launder my clothes.
1178	Not what I would expect from a hotel of this caliber.
1178	Clearly, service is not a priority here.
1181	It was a gud experience to stay in venetian.
1181	Luv the venice theme.
1181	It was a memorable trip.
1181	I luv the venetian
1182	Not as smokey as most of the other hotels on the strip.
1182	Has a great pool and way to many amenities to list.
1183	The hotel was amazing, the room was more than what I expected, the location is perfect and the restaurants were fantastic.
1184	My friend and I travel to Vegas every King holiday.
1184	We enjoy staying a different hotels.
1184	The Venetian Hotel was a pleasant experience.
1184	We were upgraded to the new section of the hotel which was very nice without additional cost.
1184	The room was nicely decorated and the beds were so comfortable for sleeping.
1184	The hotel staff were friendly, professional and helpful.
1184	We had some difficulty with leaving the parking garage going to our suite.
1184	Well, there were (3) elevators, long hallways  and very confusing.
1184	There has to be an easier way.
1184	We would overhear other guests having the same problem.
1184	Some guests would even express their frustrations to us.
1184	Overall it was a pleasant stay.
1184	Yes, I would consider staying there  again if the deal is right.
1185	We were not so lucky at this hotel.
1185	We had a pair of dirty socks on the couch upon arrival.
1185	Also there were no sheets for the pullout sofa.
1185	(Which is a big sofa, but only pulls out to a twin bed).
1185	We arrived at 9pm and asked for the sheets.
1185	They promised, they would put them in the room and we should go for dinner.
1185	But when we got back, they were not there.
1185	My husband called again.
1185	They hung up on him.
1185	Only by 11:30pm they finally came.
1185	By then our kids were exhausted and our little one had a melt down.
1185	Otherwise the hotel is cool with the canals and all.
1185	The rooms and pool area are nice too.
1185	The pullout is definitely only big enough for one kid.
1186	Confusing at first, but then again, what hotel in Vegas is not confusing.
1186	The Venitian Hotel is a great value.
1186	Once my family got used to it, we we're able to navigate through the hotel at ease.
1186	Friendly and very attentive staff.
1186	Great Chinese food at Asian Noodle at a very reasonable price.
1186	Lux Cafe (which kinda reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory) was superb.
1186	Actual NY Style pizza at the food court.
1186	The room was newly remodeled and definitely had that new room smell.
1186	Spacious suite w/ 2 very comfy queen beds along with 2 40""+ HDTVs and a living room.
1186	Very cozy for my family and espicially for my kid.
1186	She enjoyed running around the room.
1186	I would stay in this room again.
1186	Oh, and easy access to pools and Venice type mall.
1186	Safe, secure...
1186	could use less smoking patrons though.
1190	Always the best value on the strip!
1191	The Venetian was a wonderful place to stay.
1191	We were only there one night but staff was most helpful and their suggestion for dinner was awesom.
1191	Would most definitely stay there again.
1191	We wish we had more time in this trip.
1192	Hotel was right in the middle of the strip.
1192	Gondolas on the canals were fabulous and the ceilings in the hotel were breathtaking.
1192	You have just got to spend time looking up!
1193	The price was right and the location perfect!
1193	The hotel is ornate and appealing.
1193	The room was more than spacious and a great place to relax.
1193	Of course, there is so much to do in Vegas, but you wouldn't even have to leave this hotel to have a complete experience.
1193	The pool area was crowded, but we were still able to locate lounge chairs without much delay.
1193	The pool water was surprisingly cold (perhaps refreshing to some).
1193	We dined at least three times in the hotel alone.
1193	Lots of dining options.
1197	Great Night Life very good restaurants not solely focused on gambling
1199	very nice large room, great bathroom, very clean , soft nice beds and great staff !
1200	Needs better lights in room.
1200	Room was very dark no matter how many lights I turned on.
1200	Other ten that the room was great.
1201	Super expensive food and drinks, but super convenient too!
1201	Great Location; mid strip.
1201	Had a fantastic time!
1202	I enjoyed everything at the hotel.
1202	The staff was polite.
1202	The restaurants had great food.
1203	The Venetian is a wonderful place to stay.
1203	Connected to the Palazzo, there are 27 different restaurants.
1203	The pool is large enough to accommodate everyone.
1204	We arrived at night and the reception was very nice and gave us the room quickly.
1204	We asked for a room with a strip view and we got a strip view...
1204	just not the right side :)But the level of the room was very high!
1204	Totally worth the staying!
1205	A truly amazing property on the strip.
1205	You feel like you stepped into Venice.
1205	Suite was beautiful with separate bath and shower.
1205	I would recommend this to anyone wanting a first class hotel.
1206	This hotel is beautiful.
1206	The room was larger than expected because you often go to luxury hotels thinking you will get more space but you don't.
1206	We only have 2 issues, but they did not take away from overall experience.
1206	The room should have a refrigerator and microwave.
1206	It is ridiculous to not have this available.
1206	It could be cleverly concealed for aesthetic purposes.
1206	Beware that if you take things out of the bar to put your drinks in that the shift in weight will trigger charges to your account even when you put these items back.
1206	You will have to dispute this on your bill.
1206	The front desk agent was really great about removing these charges.
1206	Housekeeping kept knocking once and entering so we had to ensure we placed the do not disturb sign on the door yet remember to remove it in order to get room cleaned.
1206	Still have the drunken patrons on elevators, etc. Overall, the hotel was really good, and I am extremely lucky about hotels.
1207	Enjoyed the Venetian very much.
1207	Excellent facilities and amenities.
1208	I've stayed at a few hotels now on the strip and they can't hold a candle to the Venetian.
1209	We stayed 3 nights and used the hotel for about 80% of our experience.
1209	Lots of things to do without leaving the premises.
1210	The best hotel and location every think top of the line
1211	The best hotel for every one and all type of people
1212	The first day at Venetian, our flight was early so we could not check in right away.
1212	We went to have breakfast and do some shopping so I called the front desk to leave my cell phone number for them to call when our room was ready.
1212	The person at the front desk demanded that I return to the front desk to leave my number, would not take my number over the phone.
1212	I called the service manager to complain and we was ""cut off"".
1212	We got into our room and when my girlfriend took a bath, the water from the tub backed up into the shower with a bunch of black sludge.
1212	We called maintenance and they came up to fix it right away.
1212	Day two, bath number two, tub water backed up into the shower again, no black sludge this time.
1212	Called maintenance again, they came to the room and flushed the drain again, offered us a new room if it happened again.
1212	Days 3 and 4, no issues.
1212	The only other issue was the temperature in the hotel was freezing cold the first three days.
1212	Day 4 temperature was manageable.
1213	Rooms were very clean and organized.
1213	The whole experience was awesome!
1213	They brought me pretty much anything I needed to my room.
1213	Extra towels, extra pillows, iPod speakers (even though the room already came with and iPod dock)
1214	THIS IS A GREAT HOTEL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STRIP.
1214	WE MADE THE MISTAKE OF BOOKING OVER THE LABOUR DAY HOLIDAY.
1214	SO THE HOTEL WAS FULL OF YOUNG PEOPLE MAKING THE MOST OF THE LAST POOL PARTIES.
1214	SO THERE WAS A MUCH YOUNDER CLIENTAL ON THE HOTEL THAN ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS THAT WE HAVE STAYED THERE.
1215	This suite had plenty of room for three people...
1215	the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was really large.
1215	We enjoyed our stay at the Venetian.
1218	After many searchs for the perfect hotel for my family holiday weekend.
1218	I choose this hotel.
1218	Beautiful or any other similar word is not enough to describe it .
1218	We were expecting  Long wait lines or hard to manage or get to the hotel  etc .
1218	To our surprise we found the hotel, valet our  car , checked in and found our room in less then 20 min.
1218	This was during the labor day weekend .
1218	We stayed at the Bella suite , very spacious and nice decor .
1218	The pillows were comfortable but had a weird smell.
1218	You can request different ones.
1218	Near are other hotels , short walks to casinos , shops , and restaurants but also longs walks to other major hotels and restaurants so be prepare !
1218	Willl stay here again
1219	The hotel was staffed with knowledgable friendly and professional staff from the valet through the casino.
1219	They were always willing to help, direct, or advise when asked and made staying in such a large place more personal.
1219	Would go back in a minute.
1221	We have stayed at most of the hotels on the strip and although we have had other great experiences other places, this was one we will return to.
1221	The location is perfect, the restaurants are 5 star (Bouchon for brunch is a must), the rooms are spacious with spectacular bathrooms, and staying in the Venetian tower is really quite close getting back on on the strip.
1221	I love that they have a coffee bean and a juice bar super close to the elevators for those mornings you aren't feeling the best :).
1221	If starbucks is your thing, it's right across the street - about a 3 minute walk.
1221	The visuals of this hotel are beautiful and it is maintained to perfection.
1221	Thank you Venetian, we will be back!
1222	When I didn't like was we were awaken up at about 5 o'clock in the morning with a loud clacking clicking noise coming from the bathroom pipes and that went on for a while and that was not good since we went to sleep at 3 o'clock in the morning.
1223	Everythings are perfect, We are planning to come back soon , is the best .
1224	I was staying two nights in The Venetian on September for my honeymoon.
1224	Hotel put me in the 5th floor with ""air conditioning "" view.
1224	When open the window, we only can see the roof Of another building with tons of A/C.
1224	Room condition was alright, but a little old.
1224	Swimming pool seems little small for this busy hotel.
1224	With spending over $500 to stay 2 nights here, I rather stay in other hotels next time travelling in vagas.
1225	Had a wonderful time.
1225	Will stay here again on next Las Vegas visit.
1226	We took a short mother daughter getaway for Labor Day weekend.
1228	My only gripe, and its in most vegas hotels, but the walk from the room to the valet is always way too far.
1228	Its almost painful how far it is.
1228	I've stayed at almost 50% of the hotels in vegas.
1228	The venetian is very nice but not much better than the other 5-star suites in vegas.
1228	What was unique was the sunken living room area, which was cool because i have never stayed in a hotel with that type of living room.
1229	We love the options available in this hotel to eat, drink, spa, party, relax, gamble, etc. etc. What a great place to stay at a reasonable rate even over the weekend.
1229	But there is really no such thing as a weekend in Vegas ...
1229	the adult playland is a 24/7 gig!
1230	Lots of shopping, you never have to leave the hotel for anything!
1231	Very cleaned and comforts.
1231	My son love swimming pool while my wife enjoying the slot machines.
1232	Everything was awesome at the venetian.
1232	Thee room, food, service, shops.
1233	Fantastic service and staff went out of there way to make it a great stay,
1234	My husband and I stayed at the Venetian while coming to Vegas for a few days to attend a concert.
1234	We had never been to the Venetian, but all of the reviews that I had read prior to our stay were very positive.
1234	Our stay was no different.
1234	The hotel staff at check-in were fantastic.
1234	When we got to our room, we were blown away by the size, set-up, and cleanliness.
1234	We booked a basic luxury suite and was upgraded to the same type of room with a beautiful view of the strip, including the volcano show.
1234	The entire hotel was fantastic with all of the shops, restaurants, and the casino was one of my favorites that I had been in.
1234	Additionally, the fact that you could walk straight through to the Palazzo was an added bonus.
1234	I honestly would have been content never leaving the hotel.
1234	If you do plan on venturing out, the location is perfect and is located right in the center of it all.
1234	If ever back in Vegas, there it no doubt that we will be staying at the Venetian again.
1235	Rooms held in sound pretty well.
1236	We have just positive experiences with a small slips: smoky restroom and inadequate packing of shampoo.
1236	Otherwise everything was excellent!
1237	The hotel and staff were great.
1237	The only issue withour room was it was too dark as the lighting was to dim.
1238	I was in Las Vegas for two reasons; to attend a friends funeral and to have a reunion with a family member.
1238	I selected the Venetian because I wanted to pamper myself during an emotional time and my family member and I were planning a trip to Italy and we wanted to kind of set the mood for our trip and have a sense of the country.
1238	However, There needs to be a coffeemaker in the rooms.
1238	The hotel is so large, that we had to go so far to get a cup of coffee...
1238	this was very inconvenient.
1238	We had to get up, dress, go get coffee, come back, shower, dress and then go to our appointments.
1239	Big rooms, great location.
1239	Take advantage of the tram that runs behind Harrahs, short walk from the Venetian.
1239	Hotel guests get in free to tao nightclub til' midnight-we showed up at 1230 -didn't go in.
1239	Great pool with fun music- have a Tao pool club too.
1239	Saw Zarkana at Aria while we were there cool circus show.
1240	Rooms are spacious and well maintained.
1240	Our only problem was that when we checked in our room had not been vacuumed properly and we found some food on the floor.
1240	Maid service was adequate but they could have done a better job.
1240	Parking was confusing when checking in since there are two valet locations which were not clearly marked, one was for registration and another for visitors.
1240	Overall the Hotel is in a great location and the connecting shops and restaurants are all you need.
1240	You never have to leave the Hotel for a quick Vegas getaway.
1241	The casino isn't so big, but the hotel is very beautiful.
1242	Great hotel, fantastic room, great staff.
1242	Location is perfect - could stay just within the main facility, but great access to the rest of the strip.
1243	Very impressed with many aspects of our stay!
1243	I felt very safe and comfortable.
1243	Room was huge with very comfortable bed, clean and big bathroom and with a great view; even though it didn't face the strip.
1243	The conveniences were fantastic!
1243	Great location on the strip,  fabulous restaurants to choose from (supper at Tao was divine!
1243	), good selection of shops, and Rock of Ages had us singing all night!
1243	We have been to Vegas before and now are asking ourselves: why did we stay anywhere else?
1243	From now on its the Venetian and the Palazzo for sure.
1244	The suite was comfortable and provided some luxury.
1244	The location is quite convenient for activities and events.
1246	The staff went out of their way to greet, and help you
1247	Great place to stay, I would highly recommend it.
1248	The entire facility was gorgeous and very well maintained.
1248	The rooms are large and comfortable.
1248	You could spend your entire trip on the premises and not have to leave...
1250	We had a bad experience with Room services , the lady knok the door like a earthquake we are sleeping and forget put the sign do not disturbe.
1250	And the security Check point before Room elevator very rude.
1252	Our first weekend in Vegas we stayed at the Tahiti Village and LOVED it.
1252	We then went ti Disneyland and then came back through Vegas.
1252	So our second stay we stayed at the Venetian.
1252	The room was nothing special for how much we paid.
1252	Charged $25 a day for internet!
1252	Even the Ramada had free internet!
1252	No fridge or microwave.
1252	The pool was super lame.
1252	Overall I would just say that I wouldn't go back.
1252	Waste of money...
1252	Oh and the lost or car in the valet so we had to wait 30 minutes for them to find it...
1254	no free bottle water , no tooth brush , sleep shoes, no tooth phase
1256	We personnaly felt in love the canal and its gondolas.
1256	And Bouchon was a delight with terrific croissants
1257	Stayed at the suite.
1257	Large room with comfortable beds.
1259	Housekeeping came early even though we had do not disturb sign on the door.
1259	Not spectacular but good.
1260	We were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary.
1260	We visited many hotels along the strip but The Venetian is by far the most breath-taking of them all.
1261	Nothing to really complain about, staff was friendly where ever you were.
1261	It was a big hotel but you got the hang of it rather quickly.
1262	Weve been wanting to try orher new/contemporary hotels nearby along the strip.
1262	But my heart just wants Venetian...
1262	We love it here, from food, to shows, to clubs.
1262	And of course the room!
1262	The only thing that I gave 3stars is about the bath tub.
1262	Theres short hairs and black in the side of the tub.
1262	Which is definitely not my golden ash hair and not hubbys shaved head.
1262	But other than that its clean.
1262	Cant wait to bring our 2 boys next visit!
1263	Considering what I paid for the hotel, I expected much more in a way of Customer Service.
1263	Just having a clean good looking hotel does not make it a great hotel...
1264	I would really recommend this hotel for couples who go into Vegas for the first time there's a lot to do and see the canal shops has a lot to offer and the casino is huge, the rooms are quite big and comfortable.
1266	One of the best hotels I stayed at I'm Las Vegas
1268	Amazing , best in Vegas
1269	After many trips to Vegas our Pallazo suite, Prestige Private Club status with concierge services/benefits, appies,, Bar, Breakfasts, Internet, Wi Fi etc all added up to luxury accommodation.
1269	The resort, twin to Venetian are super quality in every respect!
1270	My car was broken in through breaking from rear window at the guest's garage.
1270	I called the security who came quickly said that the hotel have not charged the parking fee (what about facilities fee which have charged extra) so I am on my own responsibility for myself and my belonglings even I were a guest of the hotel.
1270	(where I supposed to park my car since I booked a 200 usd per night room)I asked for CCTV camera picture.
1270	The security said the hotel does not have it in the garage.
1270	It seem like the hotel's garage is a big shopping mall for thieves then.
1270	I asked for police station.
1270	He said he have no idea where to file a report.
1270	I have done contacting police by myself which said that it is almost impossible to get anything back since no one seem to care.
1270	The other case was car stolen.
1270	(Thanks to the thieve that did not steal my car then).
1270	I have never felt unprotected when I parked my car in any hotel but here.
1270	whatif there is a thieve threaten my life.
1270	what is the securities?
1271	Very good food and very nice people working there I would go back any time.
1272	I had a slight problem with getting my money that was on hold back but the Accts Rec department helped me out.
1274	Excellent stay in Venetian, it is great from all aspects!
1276	Very good experience and excellent hotel!
1277	We stayed at new tower called ""Venezia Tower"" but we needed to walk long to get to the room from front entrance...
1277	but overall it was great hotel.
1278	mostly didn't stay in room but was really impressed by the size and the sunken living room
1279	We loved the Venetian.
1279	In my opinion, it is one of the best...
1279	if not the best Hotel in Vegas.
1279	The staff was so friendly and accommodating.
1279	We visited a few different places like the Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon and every time we needed directions the concierge desk would print the directions and they even printed our boarding passes for our departure flight.
1279	The lobby is beautiful, the rooms was fantastic and the service was great.
1279	We ate at a few different restaurants at the Venetian/Palazzo and needless to say...
1279	we had an amazing experience.
1279	The food was delicious and the service was fantastic.
1279	This was a family trip and we had an awesome time.
1279	The Venetian has great pools that our kids had a great time in.
1279	Love the Venetian and would not stay anywhere else.
1280	Bed was super comfy.
1280	Unfortunately, the television in front of the bed had a really weak signal so we couldn't order any movies.
1280	This the ONLY reason they didn't get 5 out of 5 stars.
1281	Quieter location than many other hotels on strip.
1281	Good choices for meals.
1281	Staff very helpful and pleasant.
1281	It was our first trip to Vegas and we would highly recommend this hotel as well as the Palazzo (sister hotel which is connected).
1282	The shopping and restaurant experience was great.
1282	It didn't hurt to run into Ozzie and Sharon Osbourne and Celine Dion either.
1283	The hotel is clean, beautiful and the personel are very helpful.
1283	I requested a specific room/bathroom for my family physically challenged family member and the hotel was able to grant my request.
1283	The casino was a little too smoky for me.
1283	There are a variety a great restaurants.
1283	I especially enjoyed carnevino and otto's.
1283	I highly recommend this hotel because eveything is under one roof.
1284	Check in was smooth, give some extra time to get your bags if you have them hold them till your flight leaves.
1284	Room was clean, pools very nice, restaurants were good and service was pretty good.
1284	Very few $10 tables for blackjack or craps but may be due to it being a holiday weekend.
1284	Took forever to get a drink in the casino--my money was gone before my waitress arrived!
1284	Disappointed that the moving walkways weren't working.
1285	Lovely atmosphere, but it is a very large hotel...
1285	so if walking is an issue,this may be difficult.
1285	It has everything you need, over 30 restaurants andlots of shopping too.
1286	VERY BIG AND NICE HOTEL, THE CANAL SHOPS ARE WONDERFULL, OPTIONS FOR LUNCH AND DINNER INSIDE THE HOTEL, MANY POOLS, TRY TO GET THERE EARLY SO YOU CAN GET A PIECE OF SUN.
1286	IF YOU ARE FAMILY (WITH MINORS) BE CAREFULL , THERE ARE ROOMS FOR 4 PEOPLE WITH ACOMODATION ONLY FOR 3 (IS THE CASE OF THE KING SIZE)
1288	Everything about this hotel is what you could ever ask for in a Vegas holiday.
1288	Great position on the strip and out of this world rooms and facilities.
1290	Really nice Hotel, very clean, comfy beds.
1290	I was disappointed that on check in we could not get a free room upgrade.
1290	We did not want to spend anymore money so stayed with a slightly smaller king suite.
1290	The room was nice but not as luxurious as our previous stay.
1290	The window treatments were manual operation instead of the double remote control we enjoyed last time, the size was a wee bit smaller but adequate and the living room had only a small love seat instead of the large mosh pit sectional.
1290	This visit the hotel seemed very crowded, lots of people everywhere.
1290	The casino floor was really loud and overly bright and way way too smokey.
1290	We did not spend too much time in the casino mainly due to smoking.
1290	Despite the crowds we had no problem making dining reservations.
1290	So many good restaurants at this property, over 5 days we had 8 meals on site.
1290	Bouchon is a must do for breakfast and Otto in St Marks Square is great for hanging out in the piazza.
1290	We also loved B&B Ristorante.
1290	The Grand Canal Shopps are a nice mix of usual mall stores and upscale names and enjoyed shopping a couple of days.
1290	Don't miss Canyon Ranch Spa, spend the day and end at the Palazzo Pool Bar.
1290	Overall we had a great stay but with such a big property it is difficult to get that personal service and you always feel like an unknown guest.
1291	Luxury , neat, clean, u can spend the whole time inside the hotel, but check ur bill daily because they do put some charges for refreshments even if u don't use them.
1292	This hotel is truly amazing.
1293	Very pleased with the hotel and facilities.
1293	All the staff extremely friendly and good selection of restaurants and shops.
1294	I really have a good time to stay in Venetian.
1294	All service is super friendly.
1294	Room is like the model home in magazine.
1295	Room was great & the staff were very helpful & friendly.
1295	We have stayed in several of the casino hotels & the Venetian was by far the nicest.
1297	The hotel lobby is lofty and nice.
1297	There are many restaurants to choose from, but variety is somewhat limited due to similar types of cuisines being repeated; we had to go out of the hotel to enjoy other cuisines - Korean, Indian.
1297	The hotel room seems spacious, but that is due to the open design that makes the placement of 2 tvs, 1 in the ""bedroom"" and 1 in the ""living room"" nearly useless since when one tv is on, the other one cannot be turned on without clashing sound.
1297	It's like one huge room divided by a pair of steps.
1297	I've stayed in AC hotel suites that had the bedroom isolated with double doors for privacy, it doesn't appear as open, but cozier and more personal.
1297	The room seemed dusty upon initial inspection and i noticed a couple of match sticks on the carpet near the bed so the vacuuming was not very thorough; but thankfully the room smelled nice without any trace of smoke or other mal-odors.
1297	The selection of room service menu was rather sparse given the resources they could pull upon.
1297	For those who have not travelled extensively, ASKING is the key.
1297	Asking for the bed linens to be changed and extra towels was complied with alacrity and I was happy with the service.
1297	Upon asking about acquiring a razor (I had forgotten mine) I was sent up a bathroom care bag with a disposable razor, shaving cream, toothbrush, toothpaste, bath salts, extra soap, shampoo, body wash, and conditioner.
1297	The wifi service was available but unreliable depending upon the time of day.
1297	The people who answered the phone were friendly and helpful: front desk, concierge, hotel operator, IT department.
1298	Really impressed with the spacious room, lovely decor and location was close to all amenities.
1298	I have a negative comment tho' I left a note to give us blankets & to adjust the time on the radio clock but not done!
1299	This is a great hotel.
1299	The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because they charge you a resort fee.
1299	Although all the hotels I looked at in Vegas do this, I don't think it's fair.
1299	With that said this is an awesome hotel in a great location.
1301	I stay here ALWAYS after dumping Bellagio quite a few years ago.
1301	Bellagio service is impeccable, but i left for room size.
1301	This was a very disappointing trip.
1301	Not only did I have lights in my room that didn't work, I had no towels in the bathroom when I got there, I got stuck in the shower, the shower latch was broken and I was so scared the more I pushed the glass would shatter.
1301	I screamed & banged on the wall for help, it was awful.
1301	Each time I called about an issues the operators were VERY nonchalant and didn't even apologize.
1301	Back to Trump & Bellagio for me
1302	Every thing went fine ...
1302	The rooms and the restaurants as great
1303	We paid extra for a good view to the strip...
1303	but wasn't very pleased with the view we ended up with...
1305	from the moment we drove into the hotel the service was first class.
1305	the car was valet parked and our luggage was removed from the car to our room in less than 15 minutes.
1305	the check in was fast even though there was a queue.
1305	we had asked for a none smoking room and unfortunatly they did not have any so we were upgraded to the next level at no cost to us.
1305	this room (sorry suite) was to say the least fabulous.
1305	two extremely comfortable beds.
1305	with a sunken seating area to accomadate 6 people with ease 3 tv's a well stocked mini bar and a fax machine.
1305	the bathroom was plush.
1305	the one downside that i had was that the internet was chargable @16 dollars a day which i though could have been included.
1305	there are 30 different eating places in the hotel and loads to do.
1305	wish i had booked another night.
1307	The Venetian was a great hotel with a very service oriented staff, nice facilities and a great (and friendly) casino.
1307	Perfectly lcated on the strip and with a nice pool and gym (it even had a rock-climbing-wall).
1307	The check in was quick and although we came before check-in time we had no problems getting our room.
1308	the bathroom smells bad, the price is to hi for what the have.
1309	I had a great time at the Venetian!
1309	The rooms are comfortable and very nice.
1309	The only problem I had was with the mini bar.
1309	Do not touch the items or shut the mini bar too hard or you will be charged!
1309	There are very sensitive sensors in the bar.
1309	When I questioned it at the front counter the guy just rolled his eyes and said we must have touched something.
1309	I had to wait 24 hours to see if the charge appeared on my card.
1309	Other than that it's a beautiful resort to stay at.
1310	We had a wonderful trip and great time!
1310	It was our first trip to Vegas and it was even better than expected!
1310	The Venetion was top notch!
1310	Friendly staff are always there to help you and give you information.
1310	Grand Canyon was amazing!
1310	Thanks Expedia for helping to make this a wonderful experience!
1311	Typical Vegas - over the top but nice.
1311	Only real downside is the place is a rabbit warren and finding your way around is not easy.
1312	We had a great time at the Venetian.
1312	The Hotel staff - from the front desk staff to the pool deck staff- were really helpful.
1312	Everyone was super polite and wanted to make our stay comfortable.
1312	The entire hotel, including our room, was really clean and fresh.
1312	Even the Casino was light and fresh looking instead of dark and dingy.
1312	There were so many options for dining; we had many very good meals during our 6 day stay, but our very favorite was Buddy V's Italian.
1312	All of us thought is was the best meal of our entire stay.
1312	The Grand Lux Cafe ( Venetian) was also really good and it was fairly causal and not expensive.
1312	After we saw some of the other hotels, we were really glad we stayed at the Venetian
1313	The room didn't have a fridge without drinks that we could use or even a microwave.
1313	Also coffee machine would be nice but overall it was a great room.
1313	We found out layer on that we could have asked front desk for a free fridge.
1316	comfortable and the prestige package was wonderful
1317	we were offered a suite for $500.00 more because our room was not ready.
1317	They have 7000 rooms.
1317	I wonder if this is done to make the guest pay more?
1319	Can't go wrong with a stay at the Venetian - weekend in a suite - space, location, amentities were excellent.
1319	Casino, Pool & Food - were well liked by all four of us.
1320	The main pool at the Venetian had a giant floating island of scum in the corner at the stairs.
1320	I alerted the proper dept.
1320	But to no avail.
1320	The next day it was not quite an island of scum, but more of a yellow oil slick.
1320	Because of this, I would not go back to this hotel even though we were comped our resort fees for the week stay.
1320	The rest of the hotel was 5 star all the way, food, service, room etc..
1321	I enjoyed everything about this hotel.
1321	The boat ride was nice.
1321	The wax museum was fun and exciting.
1321	It was close to everything and the staff was so friendly and helpful.
1322	The only problem is that the room does not have a fridge that you can use to keep your own stuff.
1322	You can order a personal fridge from room service for $25 per night, but in the middle of the week in an off-peak season, they were out of fridges.
1322	However, they'll give you an ice bucket with ice for free.
1323	Staff was amazing and room was extremely clean.
1323	I would recommend this hotel and casino to anyone.
1323	If u are ever in Vegas, this is the place to be.
1324	Amazing hotel and one that certainly lives up to and exceeds the hype and expectations.
1324	Receptionist offered us a discounted suite upgrade at check-in, which was definitely worth it and much appreciated!
1324	The suite was amazing and huge, although we spent very little time in there.
1324	The hotel itself is a wonder on its own.
1324	So much to explore and see, it actually took us a couple hours to even leave the resort and explore the rest of the strip.
1324	I look forward to re-visiting Las Vegas and staying at the Ventian in the future.
1326	Beautiful hotel, first class staff, rooms big enough to hold a conference.
1326	Every detail of your stay is overseen by an attentive staff.
1326	This will now be our go to hotel in Vegas.
1327	It was for our wedding anniversary,we wanted a bit of excitement, we we're certainly not disappointed, except for the slot machines.
1327	They just don't pay.
1328	Excellent restaurants for all types of dining.
1328	Great location on the strip.
1329	A few small issues that didn't make our stay 100%.
1330	we enjoyed our stay very much not having to leave the hotel for anything was real nice for us older folks
1331	Ended up with an upgraded suite at palazzo, wonderful hotel with very helpful staff.
1332	Great place to stay.
1332	The only thing mussing was a coffe pot in the room for the morning.
1333	Booked a 2 queen bedroom suite equipped with a full size pull out bed.
1333	Wonderful experience with the staff.
1333	They responded quickly with any concerns we called about, and delivered at a rapid speed when we needed items brought to our room.
1333	Calm, quiet, and relaxing.
1333	Definitely added to the perfect weekend in Vegas!
1334	People smoking everywhere there ,i stay in this hotel 3 years ago and was excellent for that reason we decided to go back ,but never more ,the hotel conditions were disappointed and there was smoke everywhere and the people were smoking all over the place,i prefer the Caesar's Palace/Wynn or Encore hotels, the general cleanness of the hotel was deplorable,the room was ok.
1335	Fantastic check-in, room amenities and cleanliness!
1335	We will Only stay @ the Venetian from now on!
1336	Great room, super breakfast, great location.
1336	Good size room, bed is large and comfortable.
1338	Very nice staff , clean overall from room to public restrooms , well kept landscape ,and design , the lobby walls and ceiling s are beatiful  like a Italian art in the Vatican .
1338	I was very impressed
1339	It is a very large hotel with all the amenities.
1339	You need not go anywhere else.
1339	The shops and gondolas were a plus with opera singers and the show in the piazza was just delightful.
1339	The only disappointment were the restaurants.
1339	We had in room dining which was phenominal then we hit the strip.
1340	Everything was excellent except the wireless in the room was very sketchy.
1341	Don't expect anything less than perfect when you book at the Venetian.
1342	Great hotel, positioned close to the strip but we were put off by the odour as soon as we walked in the door.
1342	Maybe the filters need changing in the air conditioning or they need to change their brand of air freshener.
1342	Other hotels we visited did not have this issue.
1343	Nice hotel, location is very good.
1343	The detail of the building is amazing I would rate it a 5 star if not for the refrigerator, they filled it with so much items inside and was informed that if we touch any of the items inside it will be consider sold because they set it up with sensor so they don't have to come up after the guest check out to do the inventory.
1343	So that means that in order for them to minimized the inconvenience they will just annoy the guests for not being able to use the ref because you can't even put a single bottled water inside.
1343	And  when you booked any tour be prepared to go all the way to the ground transportation where it's isolated for they don't want you to use the front lobby to be picked up?
1345	BEST STAY I,VE EVER HAD.
1345	COULD,NT THINK OF ANY THING I DID,NT LIKE.
1346	WHEN I ARRIVED MY ROOM WAS NOT AVAILABLE SO THEY GAVE ME A HUGE SUITE AT NO CHARGE WITHOUT ME HAVING TO SAY A THING.
1347	Our room was amazing.
1347	Enjoyed the location as well
1348	Have always wanted to stay here, so glad we finally made it.
1350	After driving several hours we were exhausted.
1350	We just wanted to shower and go to bed.
1350	There was someone to greet us at the car but the luggage Disnt come for 2 hours.
1350	I called several times as I had a young tired child with me.
1350	Other than that the hotel and people are wonderful.
1351	This is the place to stay in Vegas!
1352	We had such a great time.
1352	All staff were super friendly and our suite was very clean.
1352	There are lots of stores and shops in the hotel and the ambiance is so great.
1352	The lobby smells amazing, like flowers.
1352	We would definitely stay at the Venetian again.
1353	Excellent service all around!
1353	My 50 plus time to Vegas, and this experience is without a doubt the best I've ever had.
1353	Expedia you now have a loyal customer for life!
1354	We actually stayed at the Palazzo and it was glorious!
1354	The room amazing, the view spectacular and the staff very helpful.
1354	We would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again.
1354	Be sure to eat at the Grand Luxe Cafe.
1354	Incredibly generous portions at VERY good prices.
1354	The small salads are ample for 2!
1355	The Venetian is breathtaking!
1355	The decor and paintings on the ceilings are beautiful.
1355	The basic room is a 650 sq foot room and the floor plan of the room was lovely and more inviting than your typical square room.
1355	We found the bed to be a bit harder than we would have liked.
1355	We did not appreciate the use of the energy saving light bulbs however.
1355	It took about 10 minutes for the light in the water closet to be bright enough to use the room with the door closed - and I don't know about you but I prefer to have some privacy when using the toilet.
1355	We ended up leaving that light on for our entire stay just so we didn't have to use the facilities in the dark.
1355	We did enjoy the location of the hotel.
1355	It was 44 degrees when we were there and with the Venetian, Pallazzo, Wynn and Encore practically all being connected by internal pedways, and with the Fashions Show Mall being right across the street, we hardly had to be out in the heat at all.
1357	Great hotel, wonderful experience.
1357	Took my parents for their first visit to Vegas.
1357	They loved the hotel.
1358	We were first time Vegas visitors and didn't really know what to expect.
1358	As seasoned travelers we've often stayed in decent hotels - Hilton, Marriott, etc., and I honestly expected similar in Vegas.
1358	The Venetian is breathtaking from the moment that you arrive.
1358	The entire experience was first rate from the greeting at the door, to check in, to having our bags delivered to our room.
1358	Gorgeous, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.
1358	Very nicely decorated, very comfortable and superbly maintained.
1358	I would highly recommend the Venetian to any Vegas traveler.
1359	Perfect hotel for a trip to Las Vegas
1361	While I've rated everything excellent above, I do have a major gripe: hotels (not just this one) are now starting to add additional mandatory fees on site to make their ""advertised rate"" appear more competitive.
1361	In this case, it was called a ""resort fee"".
1361	Since it is mandatory and I could not opt out ...
1361	it was really part of the room rate and should be advertised as such ...
1361	not in some small print somewhere that most people won't see/read.
1361	Otherwise, it is just plain and simple false advertising.
1361	The ""cost"" wasn't as advertised.
1362	I loved hotel experience.
1362	It had very nice pools and pool amenities.
1362	Loved the free valet parking which was very quick.
1362	The whole experience made you feel pampered.
1362	I would happily stay again...
1363	Fast and easy check in/check out, reasonably priced shuttle to airport.
1363	No penalty for early check in, and the room was ready for us when we arrived.
1363	Upon check out, we asked if they could waive the $ 20 resort fee, and they accepted right away!
1363	Very close to attractions, shopping, and shows.
1363	We travelled with our 6 year old, and he had a blast!
1363	(the only drawback was the constant barrage of Timeshare people from the Grandview...
1363	.), some of them do not take 'no' for an answer!
1363	This is typical of ALL hotels on the strip, so you just have to expect it no matter where you go.
1363	Excellent place, and very good value.
1363	Would stay there again.
1364	We picked this hotel because my sister recommended it and I'm very happy we listened.
1364	The rooms are very spacious.
1364	We arrived early and they let us check in earlier and were even able to do late check out at no additional cost!
1364	The atmosphere, the shops, the food and the staff all were great.
1364	We did the indoor gondola ride and enjoyed it very much.
1365	A great hotel with a supremely comfortable suite, but very large and very busy which made it hassle to get around.
1366	This was a great hotel and very much in line with a 5 star accommodation.
1368	Very nice hotel, no coffee makers in room, on weekends very loud gueststhe staff was great, room service was great, housekeeping was great.
1369	We had an amazing time, a fabulous hotel with friendly staff.
1369	The hotel was stunning!
1369	Excellent value for money and service.
1369	Thanks for the experience it was amazing!
1370	just the resturent (Zinc Dim Sum) is very bad services, I never eat there any more.
1371	Service at the hotel is impeccable - very gracious and attentive hotel staff - from valets to check-in.
1371	However, our room had several ""cleanliness"" issues -- it didn't seem that housekeeping even bothered to vacuum the carpet or clean the bathroom floor during our 3-night stay.
1371	In the interest of ""conservation"", we did not demand that they change our sheets even once, but do like to have fresh towels on a daily basis.
1371	On one particular day, housekeeping didn't even leave any washcloths (despite my leaving an envelope with a generous gratuity and instructions with the # of adults and towels needed).
1371	Also, the tv in the ""den"" area was not working properly -- so we only had one operational tv.
1371	The room also seemed especially dimly lit.
1371	It is nicely located on the Strip and relatively close to the Fashion Show for some major shopping and there is also a selection of shops available in the hotel.
1371	Watch out for a boutique called ""Hormeta"" -- reminds me of some of the kiosks at other malls -- wiith some shady guys trying to sell skincare from Switzerland (alledgedly) - shady because the price seemed so variable depending on one's waning interest or time constraints.
1371	Still one of the best hotels on the Strip -- with large, spacious suites, plenty to see and do within the hotel property itself, but nicely situated for walking to other hotel properties (Mirage, Treasure Island) to catch a Cirque show.
1372	There is a charge for everythingThe room has no kettles for tea or coffeeFound it difficult with young kidsNot the best place to stay at this price
1373	Great Hotel and good service throughout.
1373	Amazing Suite, staff were very good and concierge was good at recommending where to go and what nights were the best through the week at different hotel.
1373	Ate a lot in the hotel which was fairly priced in UK money and the Grand Lux was great, big food, good quality and great service.
1373	You could get it cheaper elsewhere but it was on the doorstep.
1373	A week was too long in Vegas but it couldn't of been more comfortable.
1373	The pool was good - only one day was it packed - which was surprising as it was 45C.
1373	Gym was reportedly good but I didn't go.
1373	Compared to other hotels I have stayed in in the strip this was really good and I really enjoyed the stay!
1375	Location service etc. All Good
1378	We stayed at the Venitian Hotel July 7th-11th.
1378	First time to Las Vegas so we're not able to compare this hotel to any others.
1378	Location - perfect, right in the middle of the strip.
1378	Hotel room/facilities/casino/shopping - perfect.
1378	It's a really beautiful spotless hotel.
1378	Restaurants - with the exception of the Grand Lux which was so-so, we found to be extremely over priced though.
1378	Delmonico's Steakhouse as an example was well over $200.00 for a Steak dinner for 2 (steak, salad, one vegetable & cocktail each).
1378	Meal and service were very good but not great which is what I'd expect for that price.
1378	A few good finds.
1378	These are not cheap eats, they are more reasonably priced high quality food restaurants.
1378	The Verandah Restaurant at the Four Seasons (lunch or dinner).
1378	The Wynn Buffet (breakfast or lunch).
1378	Mon Ami Gabi's (breakfast or lunch) - this is a popular spot for Breakfast/Lunch and I can see why - fresh fruit and lots of healthy (or not so healthy if you want it) choices.
1378	I should also mention that the atmoshphere at these 3 restaurants is very nice.
1379	This was a beautiful hotel.
1379	The staff was very professional and courteous.
1379	So many options on eating and shopping you really did not need to leave the facility.
1382	Great suite, were offered an upgrade to have a view room for an extra fee but declined it.
1382	Only problem was they have sensors on their items for purchase in the room and wanted to charge us for eating them when we only picked them up to look at them.
1382	Not a major problem.
1383	Always love this hotel
1384	ideal location great room action place never new i could get lost in a hotel
1385	Will definitely return to the Venetian on our next visit to Las Vegas.
1385	Very pleased with all the services at the resort/casino.
1385	Accommodations & all ammenities excellent.
1385	Enjoyed our time in Las vegas and all the sites.
1385	Will definitely return again.
1386	Room was great - had a fantastic suite but the hotel is just too big.
1386	getting from the parking area to the lobby and then to the room was a nightmare.
1386	The room service was non-existent.
1386	We had to call four times for some bottles to be sent to the room and in the end cancelled the order and bought them much cheaper at the pharmacy nearby.
1386	Keys didn't work which necessitated a long, long journey back to the lobby where we were basically told it was our fault and no apology proferred!
1386	There were no coffee facilities in the room - shame that they felt it necessary to nickel and dime you when you are paying so much anyway.
1386	very disappointed and certainly won't be returning!
1387	During my stay the Venetian removed money from our account several times, resulting in money owing to me of over £1,000.
1387	The manager assured me this would be resolved by the time we returned to the UK, but it hasn't, and I have emailed him twice without acknowledgement.
1387	I am extremely concerned now and intend to go to my bank to ask them to try to get the money back.
1387	I would like some support from Expedia too - so if there is another procedure for this please let me know as I did book the holiday through you and am concerned you are promoting a hotel that ultimately stole money from my account which suggests this could have been done before with other customers and future customers.
1388	What is there to say?
1388	The ONLY place to stay in Vegas!
1388	(Maybe also the Cosmopolitan) but if you one a five star hotel that ACTUALLY gives you a five star experience, the Venetian is the place to go.
1390	Overall the Venetian was a positive experience for us.
1390	Staff at the front desk were quick and pleasant during both check in and check out.
1390	We ate breakfast on their outdoor patio several times The food was excellent but pricey with an average of $20-25 per person for breakfast.
1390	Restaurant staff was generally friendly and we had good service.
1390	Hotel rooms were quite large.
1390	Housekeeping could have provided better service.
1390	A few small inconveniences in this regard- we had no shampoo in our room upon arrival and this was not provided daily- we had to phone to ask for it.
1390	After the first day we never did get a replacement plastic liner for the ice bucket.
1390	We stayed a week and the floor in the bathroom was never wiped up.
1390	We called for a cork screw to open our wine and it took them 45 minutes to deliver it and it was of such cheap quality it broke when we tried to use it.
1390	When we consulted the front desk about this no solution was offered so we never did get to drink our wine.
1390	Despite this we had a good time.
1390	The casino is not assmokey as some others we have been to.
1390	Our room was in the tower, which is very far from the lobby if you have any mobility issues.
1391	Took half an hour to check in because they didn't have the room we had reserved.
1391	Wasn't impressed with the cleanliness of the room as the garbage can hadn't been empty, there was an empty grocery bag on the floor, the mini bar was about 25% filled.
1391	They did send someone to empty the garbage can but never refilled the mini bar.
1391	We stayed there 4 nights.
1392	Room is huge, bathroom is to die for,  luxury is the theme everywhere you look.
1392	Extremely friendly hotel staff.
1393	My first trip back to Vegas after a long absence.
1393	Decided to stay one night at a place I knew would be great and the Venetian did not dissapoint.
1393	Drove in to the valet a little after 4:00 pm and Valet and Bell staff were wonderful in welcoming me and taking care of my car and luggage.
1393	Walking into the beautiful lobby, there were only 2 people in line for check-in and there didn
1394	Amazing place to experience and so big.
1394	Not sure if it is the hotel or Expedia but beware of an additional $25 hotel charge when checking in, this is for the wi-if and amenities.
1394	I would have thought this would have been included in the room rate at time of booking.
1395	A ton of shops within walking distance.
1398	Stayed here for work last year and came back this year.
1398	Great service, excellent staff they really go above and beyond.
1398	This is my hotel that I go to when I bring an SO/better half to Vegas.
1398	Can't say enough about the place!
1400	There was an empty Jack Daniels airplane size bottle in one of the drawers which I took as an oversight and threw in the waste basket.
1400	Later in the day my wife found what could have been feces on the wall of the bathroom.
1400	We then asked for the Supervisor who had the lady come back and clean.
1401	This was my first stay at the Venetian but will not b my last!
1401	Everything  about the trip was awesome.
1401	The room was large and very comfortable.
1401	Loved  the big bathroom.
1401	Housekeeping did not harass us to get into room to clean like some hotels.
1401	Every place we dined was outstanding and there are so many options to choose from.
1401	The location of the Venetian was great.
1401	Can't  wait to return!
1402	This is a good hotel, but I wonder if it is a bit past its glory days.
1402	I was disappointed that our room was not particularly clean.
1402	There were bits of food under the TV console, under the desk, and in the room corners--suggesting that vacuuming is done only in the ""visible spots"".
1402	There was dust everywhere--particularly on the phones and lamps.
1402	Either the room had not been used in months or no one had touched these things in months.
1402	Mildew inside the shower.
1402	It made me wonder how clean the other aspects of the room really were.
1402	The hotel itself--especially the Venezia Tower (not the Venetian Tower, how confusing!
1402	), is prettier and quieter and it's worth trying to book in there.
1402	The private Venezia Tower pool is gorgeous.
1402	I didn't like having to get up and immediately walk 20 minutes through 2 elevators just to find a cup of coffee, the fact that there was no fridge or coffee maker in the room means that we won't be going back there.
1405	I will stay here again soon!
1406	comfortable, relax, high recommended.
1407	Rooms were stuffy and we could smell smoke sometimes
1409	Great Hotel everything you would expect for a higher end establishment.
1409	Would have like to have seen a little less construction around the hotel.
1409	I did not really like the air/heater in the suite.
1409	The fresh air exchange in the hotel didn't seem to be doing what it should.
1409	The air just seemed stale.
1409	But that was the worst I have to complain about.
1409	Anyone who stays here will enjoy it.
1409	There are amazing boutique malls throughou the Palazzo/venetian!
1410	hotel stay and experience was excellent.
1410	Will always stay here.
1411	check in was a breeze.
1411	i was expecting long lines and slow moving.
1411	rooms were great and they helped us up with our bags.
1411	kids loved the room.
1411	would gladly stay here again on future trips.
1412	The Venetian was an excellent choice!
1412	We wandered about the city, in and out of other hotels and saw none better.
1412	Our only fault was that it was billed as having a pool and hot tub --- the hot tub was part of the spa for which you had to pay $25/person/day to use which we felt was unreasonable.
1412	There were two pools, one heated but under construction (which would have been nice to know ahead of time), the other unheated so not an option in November.
1412	Lots of families with kids which was a bit surprising; would not recommend bring little ones.
1412	This is an adult oriented destination.
1413	Stayed in a suite it was fabulous.
1413	The bathroom was amazing with a vanity, luxury tub and stand up shower.
1413	Curtains provided a total black out and were remote controlled.
1414	It was our anniversary and we always wanted to take a trip to Vegas.
1414	We had a ball.
1415	Had a pleasant time with my wife on our anniversary.
1415	Love the fact that theres numerous pool decks and thirteen pools!
1415	Theres a poolside atmosphere for all ages.
1415	Rooms clean and bed very comfortable.
1415	Love all the eateries and restauraunt.
1415	Even have a food court for those on a budget.
1415	Will def stay again.
1416	Everything about the hotel was wonderful except for the thin walls.
1416	You could hear everyone coming home which resulted in a restless night.
1417	Bought this as a package with airfare.
1417	It was a fantastic deal.
1417	The resort is beautiful.
1417	You could spend the weekend in Vegas and never leave the Venetian.
1417	So much to do.
1417	The suites are magnificent I felt save and secure.
1417	My only complaint would be that there was no hairdryer but if that is the only complaint.
1419	It was a terrific experience from the moment we stepped out of the car.
1419	The suite was spacious and clean, the bathroom was perfect and the beds were comfy along with the pillows.
1419	Security at the hotel was great and any incidents we saw were handled quickly and quietly.
1419	The restaurants were very good and we both agreed that even if we found ourselves at another hotel we would return to eat at the Grand Lux Cafe, it was spectacular!
1420	Stayed 3 days in Vegas.
1420	First 2 nights I stayed off strip and it was a unpleasant stay.
1420	Decided to stay my last night at Venetian and it was a blast!
1420	I wish I had stay the whole trip there.
1421	My stay there was quite pleasant and enjoyable.
1421	I would recommend anyone staying there.
1421	With the time of year (mid December), staffing was light, but so was my price.
1423	Best place in Vegas to stay
1425	staying on the lower floors is associated with cigasretts smoke which can be quite strong and irritationg.
1425	it is not limited to venitian but wass definetely more pronounced
1428	Enjoyed everything about the hotel.
1429	Without a doubt this is the nicest place I've ever stayed.
1429	Gorgeous hotel, spotlessly clean and soooo posh !
1429	Would love to return !
1431	You can't go wrong with a stay at The Venetian!
1431	Everything, from the guest rooms, to the casino, to the common restrooms, to the shopping, is so carefully cleaned and well-maintained.
1431	Thanks for another great stay!
1432	Disappointed that there was no facility to make coffee in your room or able to store drinks in fridge.
1432	Cleaning staff did not fill up shower wash etc each day or enough towels.
1432	Registration staff not very clear with instructions of amenities.
1432	However, plenty of places to eat within the hotel
1433	Great staff, excellent restaurants, fun casino.
1434	Fabulous hotel would highly recommend it to friends and family
1435	It was just and only an OK hotel.
1435	TOO large, TOO many children, and the socio-e
1436	Beautiful hotel with very comfortable rooms.
1436	Great location on strip.
1436	Definitely would recommend to friends.
1436	One of the best hotels we've stayed at in our many travels.
1437	Cons:  Difficult finding economical airport bus transfer to hotel.
1437	Tobacco smoke ubiquitous, foul, unworthy of grand surroundings.
1437	Losses increased cost - Oops,   Auto charges for lookingat unused items in room (sensors)Pros:  __Grand__architecture, art, spaces, cuisine/restaurants, room 11-328, helpful staff, location on strip""
1439	I ask for outside Room,I made Reservation long time ego, He said first come first serve,Thank you,I am not Happy But we want make reservations through Expedia
1441	Very friendly hotel staff & most accommodating.
1441	What was particularly disappointing was the inconsistency of the maid service.
1441	Dirty glasses were continually left, often the ashtray wasn't cleaned & one day the towels weren't changed just because they were hanging up!
1441	Not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel.
1441	Other than that, a lovely stay.
1442	My fiance and I vacationed at this hotel for my birthday, we stayed for a week.
1442	We enjoyed every aspect of our stay.
1442	The suite style set up of the room was great and the beds were really comfortable.
1442	The staff was very attentive and polite.
1442	The hotel has an excellent location on the strip lots to see and do within walking distance.
1442	We would definitely stay here again :)
1443	The Venetian was a great place to stay.
1443	Plenty to do on property from dining to shopping.
1443	Rooms are large and very well kept.
1443	The staff was helpful and pleasant.
1443	Had one of the best Black Jack Dealers of all times ( Larry)Had a great trip and would stay again.
1444	The Venetian was absolutely beautiful ...
1444	amazing interior and exterior.
1444	Bed was extremely comfortable right from the first night.
1445	Everything that you would expect.
1445	Great facility and friendly, helpful staff.
1445	One minor item was no coffee in the room.
1445	Was told due to fire hazard.
1445	We did overcome that by purchasing a small maker at the local Walgreens.
1445	Other than that, super place with everything that you could ask for including rental desk in front foyer.
1445	Saw the show by Human Nature at the Venetian.
1445	Don't miss it if you like Motown!
1446	Stayed at the Venetian two night it was the best stay ever.
1446	Loved the room the bed was extremely comfortable and not to mention the bathroom,awesome .
1446	I loved the fact that we were so close to almost everything .
1446	V show at Planet Hollywood was great and the buffet .
1446	We had VIP tickets but not worth it because it was too close to the stage .
1448	One of the best in Vegas...
1448	starting to look a little outdated but is clean and well mantained.
1449	First of all staff was very helpful, about the hotel decoration is stunning, loved the pools specially Tao beach!
1449	nice place to party.
1449	Rooms are very comfortable and clean with good room service!
1449	I totally recommend the Venetian!
1451	It was amazing stay at the Venetian.
1451	We ended up getting a room upgrade to the Palazzo and it was absolutely spectacular.
1451	Went during the busiest weekend (Mayweather vs.
1451	Pacquio fight) and it was fully packed.
1451	Will highly recommend staying here.
1454	Staff was amazing; room was beautiful.
1454	I am a clean freak and the room was up to my standards.
1454	I will stay again.
1455	I'm picky the rooms were very clean and comfortable!
1458	Wow what a great hotel, went into several hotels on the strip this is the nicest hotel on  the strip.
1459	Everything is perfect except for the smell of the room.
1459	It smells like a new room.
1459	But everything else is very good.
1459	The suites is very large.
1459	The price for a five star hotel is very  cheap.
1459	They offer free self parking.
1459	People are also very nice.
1459	The front desk and the elevator to the suites and the elevator to the garage are all far apart.
1459	It takes a while to remember all the ways.
1459	But in general, this is a nice place to live.
1460	Check in was quick and very friendly, rooms big and gorgeous.
1460	The cleaning staff was excellent and very accomodating.
1460	Unfortunately the restaurants staff was inexperienced and very confused and not very outgoing.
1460	If you want a drink in the casino play at the card tables because that is the only place you will find waitresses.
1460	If ordering a drink from the slot machine be prepared to wait atleast half hour or more.
1460	Very dissappointed in that.
1460	Grazie desk staff was excellent !
1461	We really enjoyed our stay.
1461	Huge room and plenty of shopping to keep my wife happy
1462	The room was quite large and beautiful.
1462	3 complaints--no coffee maker in the room.
1462	We were told it was for safety ?
1462	The towels were very stiff and scratchy.
1462	A hotel of this caliber should be able to offer better bath linens.
1462	One of the bath towels had a lipstick stain on it that had not been removed in the laundry.
1463	While I have been to Vegas twice before, I still wanted to stay at Venetian.
1463	It is one of the most beautiful hotels in Vegas with amazing art and paintings.
1463	The indoor canal is very nice with amazing shopping and food options.
1463	The hotel is centrally located on the vegas strip so everything is easily accessible.
1463	The room was very comfortable despite the cost.
1463	The pool and other facilities are very nice and clean.
1464	The Venetian was amazing.
1464	Everything was top notch.
1464	I wish I could have stayed longer.
1464	I will definitely be back.
1465	Night stand had a light in it.
1465	Which hand to be unplugged to turn it off.
1465	Carpet needed to be steamed.
1465	Through out entire place.
1466	Excellent staff, very friendly - the free shuttle is a great service provided for guests.
1466	Hard to find a better place to stay close to LAX!
1467	The room was really nice, the bathroom was beautiful.
1467	The room safe was very small, couldn't fit everything we would have liked to put in it.
1467	Also (and I don't know how this is fixable), you hear EVERYTHING going on in the hallways.
1467	Several times every night, we would wake up to people being loud in the hallways (walking back to their rooms from the bars or casino).
1467	I wouldn't say this is the place to be if you are looking for a restful night of sleep, but if you can sleep through the noise it's a really beautiful place.
1468	This massive hotel is stunning on Las Vegas Strip, rooms are huge & very comfortable.
1468	public areas are impressive as is casino.
1468	Pool area is lovely but very crowded and impossible to find space at times.
1468	I feel like a lot of placing towels on beds at early hour and then disappearing half the day is tolerated at this hotel and i think they should review that.
1468	The concierge service wasn't impressive...
1468	when i spoke to them on phone i felt even tho i was asking for basic help, they couldn't really be bothered.
1468	When i went to the desk, i felt they seemed to be helping others ok but i got 'sorry cant help' my impression of Vegas is anything is possible, but i feel they only want involved in larger requests.
1468	They smiled at all times & they were very nice but they were no help atall.
1468	Overall love this hotel, but dont rely on their help.
1469	I've stayed at the Venetian two other times before - Overall the hotel is very nice.
1469	The suites are a good size and comfortable but needs an overall updating of the look.
1469	The staff is all very nice and accomodating but the speed of service was dismal to say the least, starting with them bringing our luggage to our room, which they didn't until we called again to remind them.
1469	From there the speed of service remained in a downward spiral - we had to call 4 times to request 2 blankets and they finally came 2 hours later.
1469	We called to request silverware and were told it would cost $10.00 (over $1 apiece), we requested ice buckets twice and it took over an hour.
1469	Shall I go on?
1469	Aside from this, the shops and restaurants were very nice.
1471	The Venetian has a wonderful shopping gallery and a good position on the Strip.
1471	It is a huge hotel so do not expect a relaxing place.
1471	Cool atmosphere and clean.
1471	Rooms are really large but the view is often on the pool side for basic suites which are on lowest floors and for ours aside the lifts...
1471	Overall a good place but make sure with them what you will get before going to Vegas.
1473	Beautiful hotel with a super friendly and accommodating staff.
1473	We arrived early in the morning, but even though check-in was not until 3 pm, we were given our room anyways.
1473	The room was very nice, and the hotel in general was spectacular with the winter festivities in front of the hotel off the strip every night.
1473	Not being centrally located on the strip requires a little more walking to visit all the hotel/ casinos, however public transit is plentiful.
1473	I would definitely return to this hotel in the future.
1475	Hotel room very nice, with lots of space for my husband and me.
1475	Recommend the Grand Deluxe Cafe, food is delicious and good price for quality.
1475	The Grand Canal Shoppes between the Palazzo and Venitian has very nice restaurantes (went to Otto and Cañoncito) and the atmosphere of the whole place is so pleasant.
1478	Closer to the main part of the strip (even though there was no view) but the bed was hard and there was no water pressure.
1478	It was noisy and the walls were thin.
1478	Sadly we paid less last year to stay at the palazzo and it was a much better room and it had a view.
1479	GREAT LOCATION, SHOWS, CASINO, FOOD (LOTS OF RESTAURANT CHOICES, SECURITY, PRIVACY
1480	Great room, a whole lot of space
1481	Felt like we were in the REAL Venus!
1482	The hotels was absolutely breathtaking.
1482	However I can't say the staff was eager to make our stay most enjoyable.
1482	We were travelling with friends and wanted to have a room next to them.
1482	We were told that was the case.
1482	When we got up to our rooms it turned out we weren't even that close.
1482	The woman lied to us and when we got back down to the lobby, she was gone.
1482	Clearly her shift ended.
1483	this is the second time at this hotel and we would stay there again.
1485	Service was great, hotel was good, with wonderful F&B outlets.
1485	However, be careful of touching the fridge and snack tray - these have built-in sensors - even lightly moving either (I thought I would store the kids' milk in the fridge) will result in charges for items.
1486	This hotel was so beautiful there were so many things to do and so much shopping available all within the hotel not including the short walking distance to the mall for more shopping!
1486	I would recommend this hotel to anyone!
1486	The hotel staff was so helpful and very nice everywhere.
1486	The room was absolutely a 10,it was beautiful, and the bed was so comfortable!
1486	We will definitely be staying here again!
1487	We stayed here for my boyfriend's 30th.
1487	Overall the hotel was great.
1487	Keep in mind the hidden costs and fine print.
1487	I prefer to be told straight out I need to pay rather than finding out later.
1487	I was told there 'may be' resort fees that apply, which there were.
1487	I inquired about the Venentian airline shuttle and it wasn't until boarding that they told us there were charges that applied, I just happened to have enough cash to pay for our small group with nothing leftover for tip.
1487	I prefer to plan and budget and some of these hidden costs really eat at the experience.
1488	It was absolutely awesome!
1489	The bath towels smelled horrible like they were damp.
1489	The drain had a unique smell coming from it.
1489	This place has a dated feel to it.
1489	The restaurant the table 10 is awesome (palazzo)
1490	I went with my family, I really thought I was going to have the best experience, but the room was not clean, the bathroom estab dirty and the bed had hair, it was nasty, and bueo I travel with my young children, and lobby of people do not speak correctly, ie you have to have patience because they are children and obviously is another type of treatment and the woman who was going to check in was very rude and was referring to me.
1491	Our stay at the Venetian was phenomenal.
1491	We spent a night in the Kings Suite, and I was very impressed with everything about the hotel.
1491	Unfortunately, our car was broken into in the parking garage.
1491	Security did their best to offer sympathy, but I was disappointment about the amount of revenue generated at an establishment as such with no camera systems in their parking garages.
1491	I understand that these things happen, and we need to do better at securing our personal items.
1491	It was just a big bummer at the end of an amazing trip.
1491	I hope the Venetian team considers a camera system for the parking garages for their hotel guests and casino patrons.
1492	We really like it.
1492	This is our second time in this Hotel.
1493	Overall excellent stay in Venetian when compared to other 5 *'s.
1494	Great hotel with all the staff super friendly, warm and attentive, always saying good evening to you and such.
1494	Thought I had lost something at the spa and the guys there went above and beyond to look for it; ended up just misplacing it in my room cause it was so big.
1494	Also, the $20 trick works well here: slid the front desk girl one and asked for a late check out and for the $30/night resort fee to be waived since I wasn't using anything it paid for.
1494	She gladly took care of all of it.
1495	Air circulation are very poor.
1495	Condition and upkeep are diaapointing.
1496	Good food and lots of entertainment!
1496	Well located in the center of the Strip.
1496	Blackjack rules in the hotel casino are not favorable.
1496	Other casinos in the area offer better blackjack games
1500	My wife and I have now been to Vegas three times, and have stayed at three different hotels.
1500	The Venetian, in our opinion, was simply average.
1500	To start with the good, the staff were excellent.
1500	Every staff member we encountered from check-in, to the cleaning staff and the attendants at the pool were exceptional.
1500	The room was also very clean when we arrived and thoughtout the remainder of our stay.
1500	What was somewhat disappointing is that we paid for a view of the strip, and I suppose in a sense our room faced the strip.
1500	However, we couldn't see much of anything except the road towards the parking garage and the rooftop of the neighbouring hotel.
1500	As well, we had to run the hot water in the shower for about 3-5 minutes each morning before the water would get hot enough to actually shower.
1500	Not sure what caused this, but I've never experienced that at any other hotel on the strip.
1500	All in all, we enjoyed most of our stay, but the view and water situation turned us off a little.
1501	MY ROOM STUNK LIKE BURNT MEAT, DAY AND NIGHT, I HAD TO SLEEP WHILE SMELLING THAT STENCH.
1501	I CALLED THE FRONT DESK TO COMPLAIN AND THEY SAID CARELESSLY, YEAH YOU MAY HAVE AN OPEN VENT BY A RESTAURANT WE CAN SEND YOU AN AIR FILTER, INSTEAD OF OFFERING TO CHANGE MY ROOM AND THEY SAID SORRY WE CANNOT COMPENSTAE YOU, I WASNT EVEN LOOKING FOR MONEY OFF...
1501	AS I WAS EATING BREAKFAST I WAS SMELLING THIS DISGUSTING MEAT OR PORK SMELL COOKING, IT WAS TERRIBLE...
1501	FOR WHAT I PAID, I WOULD NEVER EVERY STAY THERE AGAIN.
1501	WAY WAY OVER RATED...
1502	My husband and I stayed for 3 nights for his 40th.
1502	I'd stayed in the Palazzo before, which is amazing, but not the Venetian, so we decided to check it out.
1502	After we checked in and got to our room, I was immediately annoyed by the neighbors.
1502	They were extremely loud, and we're slamming the door repeatedly (like 20 times in 10-15 minutes).
1502	I knew that was not going to work, so we called the front desk to request a room change.
1502	Initially the person who answered the phone, Dennis, did not want to let us change rooms, but my husband insisted, and he did allow us to switch.
1502	After that, everything about the room was great.
1502	It was very clean, and was well decorated.
1502	The Venezia tower is beautiful to walk through, and the pool garden is perfect.
1502	The only negative thing about the facility is the layout.
1502	If you are stating in the Venezia tower, you need a map or GPS to find both sets of elevators to access your rooms.
1502	Those twisty hallways are certainly a detractor.
1502	Definitely wear comfortable shoes if you stay here.
1502	I didn't, and I was sorry.
1503	Enjoyed our stay at the Venetian.
1503	The pool area could use more variety of music other than the techno music from TAO Beach.
1503	Front desk was really helpful and friendly
1504	We were in town on business for an expo at the Sands, and this hotel was very clean, updated, and had plenty of good restaurants.
1504	We loved the fact that we didn't have to walk outside to get anywhere- the convention center and plenty of restaurants were all inside and connected through walkways.
1504	The only complaint would be that our room was very close to the hall with the elevators, and we could hear noise in that hallway through the late hours of the night- until about 3 am.
1504	We were here for business, not vacation, and had early wake up times, so this was VERY annoying.
1504	Next time I would ask for a room farther down the hall to hopefully avoid the noise of the late night partiers.
1504	This is why I have to give it only 4 stars...
1504	Everything else was great.
1505	First and foremost there was no complementary coffee in the room, so everyone had to leave the motel to get a morning coffee.
1505	I found the admitting desk to be not very friendly; when we checked out, they just said thank you for choosing the Venetian not even interested if we enjoyed our stay.
1505	The $25 resort fee is over the top; I found the coupons that were given for the resort fee were ridiculous and a bit insulting; the 30% off coupon was worth less than the $10 off coupon that was given in the street, and one free small coffee not two - there are 2 guests,, right?
1505	Not impressed with the other coupons either.
1505	I bought it for the Wi-Fi; I feel a $5 per day charge would be fair; I'm not going to spend a lot of time on the internet, but I wanted to go on a bit.
1506	Great hotel and staff top notch service friendly.
1507	Had a great 4 night stay at the Venetian with my best friend, we went for my birthday.
1507	The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are amazing and huge, and the beds are super comfy, I could live there.
1507	Great location, great view, just really enjoyed my stay.
1507	My negatives are the room cleaning only seems to happen if you are out of the room very early in the morning, we are late sleepers as we stay out late and room was cleaned and made up 1 of 3 days after we found a housekeeper and advised them we were leaving the room if they wouldn't mind popping over.
1507	There was no service card in rooms to hang out to advise housekeeping to make up room in the afternoon.
1507	Would have liked to have a free fridge that could be used to put other drinks and snacks in, the one in room is only the mini bar and if you remove anything you will get charged b/c it's on a sensor.
1507	Rooms are beautiful but would be nice to have that option to have a fridge to use other than the minibar rather than pay per day to rent one.
1507	All in all it was a fabulous stay, I would recommend to a friend or a stranger.
1508	Like the hotel location, very easy access to my favourite bakery, Bouchon and Grand Lux cafe.
1508	I was disappointed with my strip view room, after paying extra, I only got partial view of the strip and not so good view of the messy pool below.
1508	Room amenities were nothing exceptional, wished we could make use of the refrigerator.
1509	Really cool stay in this hotel, well located on the Strip with great atmosphere in the Hotel.
1509	Room is also fantastic, best looking room I've ever stayed in!
1510	We go to Vegas quite often so we're quite familiar with the hotels on the stripVery nice hotel.
1510	Every room from this hotel are suites so you will get a lot of space.
1510	The bed was super comfy but the pillows were not- they're the pillows that sink your head all the way down and gives no support to head and neck.
1510	The headboard of the bed was super dusty.
1510	I don't think the maids cleaned that area for awhileThe pool was nothing spectacular.
1510	I think they should clean the pool area more often.
1510	We went down to the pool at 11am and there were floaties at every corner of the pool.
1510	Don't know what they were but it looked like a build of a gunk and water particles that were forming bubbles.
1510	It was pretty disgusting to look at and discourage us to go into the pool.
1510	I expected better maintainence at a 5 star resortAll the staffs at the hotel was very pleasant.
1510	From front desk, security, show attendees, casino workers, restaurants staff, etc.
1511	Only problem was no hand towels left by housekeeping twice.
1512	The customer services was subperb!
1512	I love how many incredible restaurants this place and the Plazzo have.
1512	The showers in the rooms are amazing!
1512	The only bad thing I can say is that the hotel is so large, it's difficult to navigate.
1512	The casino is not a place I've ever won a cent.
1512	This is a perfect hotel for couples - very romantic
1514	I have always wanted to stay at the Veneitan Hotel but felt it did not fit my budget.
1514	I got a great vacation package deal through Spirit Airlines from Portland, Oregon to LV and this particular hotel was not that much higher than much more modest hotels.
1514	I am so glad I chose this hotel.
1514	From check in to check out I had a wonderful stay.
1514	The suites were very clean and comfortable.
1514	The front desk staff were accomadating and very courteous.
1514	I have never gone to Las Vegas and not waited in ridiculously long line to check in.
1514	My wait was less than 5 minutes.
1514	The Public House restaurant was amazing.
1514	Drinks and gambling so fun.
1514	We really felt no need to go out and explore other casino's and hotels as we were so happy being at Venetian.
1515	While you can get a great deal on this website, be prepared to pay resort fees, and outrageous amounts for food/drinks.
1515	But honestly, it's worth it if you can afford it!
1515	The pools alone are worth it.
1516	wont do holiday weekend again.
1516	but as for the hotel and staff it is well worth the money/
1517	it's nice hotel ,the room is big,everything is good,iwill stay here again.
1518	Rooms are soooo comfortable and ac is great!
1518	The beds are extremely comfortable and views are amazing.
1518	Second time coming here and looking forward to a third
1520	Everything in the hotel was great.
1520	However we did have some issues with the mini bar, we were continued to get charged throughout our stay there because all the items were on a weigh scale and any change in weight would trigger an additional charge, we never touched anything on the minibar so it was an issue that shouldn't have happened.
1520	But the employees were wonderful, the hotel was great, nice getaway!
1521	Staff were friendly and helpful.
1521	Great location on the strip.
1522	GIANT Hotel (kind of confusing initially to get your bearings) but great hotel with a convenient location.
1523	For a hotel that expensive it was extremely noisy and full of drunken red necks
1524	The valet and bag check service is abysmal.
1524	Prepare yourself for a LONG wait!
1524	When I pny up the cash for a room at these prices I expect my experience to be stellar from arrival to departure...
1525	It was a great experience to stay in the nice hotel in Venetian
1527	The hotel is the best on the strip.
1527	It has everything you need at your fingertips -- restaurants, casino, nightlife, pool, spa, shopping, entertainment and ambiance.
1527	It's within walking distance to Ceasar's, Wynn, Bellagio and a major mall if the shopping at each of those resorts isn't sufficient for you.
1527	The only complaint I have are that they charge a mandatory resort fee of $25 plus tax per night.
1527	It comes out to about $28 and it's supposed to be for high speed internet (which did not work that well inside the suite but worked better in public areas), daily newspaper (which you have to pick up yourself); gym (very nice but had i used it once maybe it would have been worth the charge); 1 coffee (at a cafe that was as difficult to find as the exit to the resort) and printing of your airline boarding pass (who needs that service if you have a smart phone - let's go green, Venetian!
1527	). Many resorts charge a similar fee but for the price they charge per room, I think it's an unnecessary imposition.
1529	Fav destination for couples and pretty much everyone who love Vegas for the Romance!
1530	Floor flooded after hard rain so elevators did not work.
1530	So that made us have to walk up and down the stairs for six floors.
1530	I did not like that at all!
1531	No hot water for baby's milk powder
1532	very bad in hospitality; booked it will be one of the best ones;  folks were quite rude; bad experience at checking ; in room dining is good and rooms are good ; but leaves a bad taste when people are not good
1533	We've stayed at the Venetian several times before and were always impressed.
1533	This time it was much less impressive.
1533	First and foremost they took away a slot machine that I always only play in Vegas - Jackpot Party.
1533	Last January, there were 2 of these in the hotel; now there are none.
1533	This in itself almost spoiled the trip for me.
1533	Second, we ended up havnig to pay $45 more a night for a room that was exactly the same as the last two trips to Vegas.
1533	The first room given to us this time was very dark, looking over the roof of a building and in poor condition.
1533	When we asked to get a room comparable to what we had before, we had to pay $45 a night more.
1533	At checkout, we complained and the manager knocked off the $20 a night resort fee, which we appreciated, but still didn't feel great about.
1533	The drink service was almost non-existent and quality of the drinks is embarrassing, to say the least.
1533	Over the span of a week, there was only one server that came back to us again after the first drink (and we tipped $5 for 2 drinks) and only one time that the drink actually tasted as it should.
1533	On one occasion, we became tired of waiting and since we were sitting right next to a bar, decided to buy ourselves a drink.
1533	The bartender appeared annoyed to serve us and charged $22 for 2 rum and cokes that were almost as bad as the ones previously served by the floor server.
1533	My nephew had a similar unpleasant experience.
1535	i did not like the fact that vendors were continously chasing you to either buy there products or get tickets for a show or tour.
1535	they hounded you non-stop which i found very annoying.
1535	i felt like i was in mexico and have the natives bothering me.
1536	The room was clean with wonderful views!
1536	It was my fiance's first time in Vegas and he was amazed.
1537	great hotel- clean , roomy suites.
1537	it's like staying at home in luxury!
1538	Great place to stay in Vegas
1539	We want stay there soon!
1539	luxury and perfect for everyone
1540	Hands down, the best hotel/resort in Las Vegas!
1540	Excellent staff and service.
1540	Best poker room in Vegas!
1541	The 3 of us ladies very much enjoyed our stay in the Venetian Hotel .
1541	The suite is beyond comfortable and the hotel must be constantly upgrading the rooms and hallways as everything was spotless and showed no sign of wear.
1541	Both the interior and exterior of the hotel are wonderful and the location is ideal if you are a shopper as it is directly across from the mall.
1541	The only issue we had was one of a delayed room cleaning which left us having to order fresh towels in order to get ready for our dinner and evening show.
1541	I would definitely stay at the Venetian again.
1542	I think the service by the staff is average compared to other hotels we've stayed at on the Strip.
1543	Great vacation with friends.
1543	Hotel pool is great!
1545	First time at the Venetian, second time to Vegas.
1545	It was such a nice hotel, my only disappointment was in the daily room service - two days - used facecloths taken no fresh ones left, one day - old towels left and no new ones, when we arrived to our room two packages of the pricey nuts were empty - I called down to advise the front desk and ask that I not be charged, it took 2 more days to replace those boxes.
1545	Small things, but disappointing when everything else was top notch - fitness centre (Canyon Ranch) is awesome, great pool and outdoor area, friendly staff, great location, easy to get a cab, lots of great restaurants and shopping - all in all very good.
1546	Other than not receiving towels in a timely manner our stay was extra special!
1547	First time at the Venetian and it was amazing!
1547	Location is perfect, hotel is amazing, restaurants serve amazing food, day clubs and night clubs are some of the top ones in Vegas .
1547	Pools and luxury suite was amazing also.
1548	The hotel itself was OK.
1548	I was unhappy with the mini bar situation as the only fridge in the room was stocked with what the hotel chooses and not what we preferred.
1548	I asked if they could remove some of the items I did not want and replace with different items we wanted.
1548	I was told not unless we wanted to pay for all the items in the fridge.
1548	I thought that was extremely unprofessional.
1548	Also, the staff did not replace the items that were used in the fridge until I called the front desk.
1548	I would have preferred to have an empty fridge available to stock with whatever we wanted.
1548	There are no fans in the bathroom?
1548	We requested non-smoking; which we received, but the entire hotel floor reeked of cigarettes as soon as you opened your room door.
1548	Why not have an entire floor non-smoking?
1548	Restaurants and shopping extremely overpriced.
1548	When we booked the room, we assumed a room with a view meant a view of the strip, but instead we received a room with a view of the Palazzo and a building under construction.
1549	As the title says, this Hotel, like most it seems in Las Vegas, is HUGE!
1549	You will get lost and probably more than once.
1549	We really enjoyed our stay there although we are not gamblers.
1549	Quite noisy in the general casino area but in your room, it could be a million miles away.
1549	The room was in fact a suite and it was first class.
1549	I recommend that you hire a car for a couple of days of your stay at least.
1549	If you do, book it before you go and collect it at the airport or have it delivered.
1549	We made the mistake of not doing this and Avis (The only car rental people in the Hotel) advised that they only had ONE car available.
1549	It was the most expensive car they had and it was a monster.
1549	We booked an early morning call and a shuttle bus to the airport.
1549	Fortunately we did not depend on the early morning call and there was an abundance of taxis even at 2.30am.
1549	Thirty five dollars including tip to the airport!
1549	By and large, the Hotel was 1st class although overpriced in many areas.
1549	It is Las Vegas after all and you have to expect everything to be at a premium I guess.
1549	We found an Italian Pizza place within the Hotel where the prices were realistic and one night they even did wine at half price.
1549	This pleased my Wife immensely.
1549	We only stayed 4 nights and I feel to do it properly two weeks would cover it.
1549	There is a lot to see locally and you will also want to see the Hoover Dam and The Grand Canyon etc. Lots of golf courses around too.
1552	It was the best two day vacation of my life ever .
1552	This hotel is so amazing.
1552	There's so much to see and the restaurants are absolutely fabulous.
1552	I enjoyed the entire staff.
1552	A very friendly environment.
1552	I will definitely stay here again.
1553	Exquisite decor luxurious so roomy.
1553	But easy to get lost in.
1553	Lux cafe terrific food.
1554	Went her to celebrate my birthday.
1554	Very nice rooms, and awesome service.
1554	We got the in room breakfast option and it was very good.
1556	The hotel was located in a comfortable part of the strip!
1556	The staff was very courteous.
1556	I even sent my wedding gown down to be cleaned and pressed and they did an awesome job.
1557	We stayed for 3 nights 4 days, did a lot of gambling, eating and went to see La Reve.
1557	We ate at The Cut, which was AMAZING best meal I have had yet, full lobster tails and three different steak trio with sides and wine.
1557	Sushi Samba was also amazing!
1557	So different, sushi was amazing, sea bass skewers, yellow tail fish tacos superb!
1557	Best Hotel we have stayed at yet on the strip.
1557	So unique with the river, Gondalla and European style inside with all the shops and things.
1559	As usual, the Venetian doesn't fail to impress.
1559	It feels easier to swallow than say the overly large Caesar's and certainly feels classier, especially on the casino side of the Paladin where there are non-smoking sides.
1559	The rooms were great, except some things didn't work, like the TV in the bathroom or the iPod doc in the bedrom - I would have rated the room as fantastic if but for those things.
1559	Great restaurant choices and pleasant staff.
1559	All in all, definitely worth staying in again.
1560	i will definitely go back there in the near future...
1561	Spent five days at the Venetian.
1561	Beautiful, large suite rooms, extravagant decor, friendly, attentive staff, centrally located.
1561	My only negative would be the food at the hotel can't compare to some of the other hotels.
1561	No buffet to speak of (both the Wynn and Caesars have incredible, delicious buffets and the Mirage has fantastic steak house) , the three restaurants we tried were just so-so.
1561	Also their slot machines were cold!
1562	The hotel is fabulous.
1562	the room was big and clean.
1562	We spent one day during the week at a very convenient price.
1562	Very good restaurants ( I suggest Otto, bastianich/ batali restaurant).
1565	A great spot with an amazing view.
1565	We had a suite with stepped down sitting area.
1565	Lots of room to sit and count the money I lost lol or relax after a long day.
1565	My wife was happy which sealed the deal for me.
1565	Everyone was good and it is defiantly worth the rating.
1568	Ok, room view was terrible.
1568	Not as nice as it looked online.
1568	We will try another hotel next trip.
1571	We lost water in our suite on day 2 of our stay which was annoying, but we we're quickly upgraded to a better suite effectively and efficiently!
1572	Excellent hotel - suite was amazing - although on 14th floor a little noisy during weekend beach party.
1572	Staff helpful and friendly.
1572	Right on the 'strip' with good facilities and in house bars, cafes and resturants.
1575	Everything was build too far away from each other.
1575	Total number of minutes to get from parking to hotel room is more than 30 minutes.
1575	15 mins to walk from parking building to hotel lobby.
1575	Have to take two elevators just to get to the room floor.
1575	For the price that we paid, it is not worth to come back.
1576	Stayed at the Venetian for a weekend with my boyfriend.
1576	We absolutely loved our suite.
1576	It was well maintained, as if everything were brand-new.
1576	The hotel staff was friendly, always smiling and helpful when necessary.
1576	We enjoyed our stay; definitely a five-star experience.
1577	Great room very comfy What can one say its Vegas and this has to be one of the top Hotels there id stay here again in a second
1578	Had a great time at the pool.
1578	The restuarants were great.
1580	Love this Hotel, Suite was magnificent.
1580	I felt like I was in a palace, will defintitly return...
1582	The room was a perfect sz bed separated from the coach area!
1583	This was our 4th visit to Vegas, the last one being about 15 years ago!
1583	The Venetian hotel wasn't up and running on our last visit and we wanted to stay here as we had heard a lot about it.
1583	We were here celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary (Vegas was one of our honeymoon destinations).
1583	We were'nt disappointed: lovely hotel, well situated on The Strip, walking distance from other casinos, shops and restaurants.
1583	Lively casino area, more than other large hotels we visited on The Strip.
1583	The hotel is very clean and full of venetian decor, althought it's about 15 years old, it is not dated or run down as it's very well looked after.
1583	The Venetian boasts great shops and restaurants.
1583	We ate at a few of the restaurants and all were very good: Buddy Vs, Noodle Asia, Canalettos and food courts.
1583	We didn't try the pool as the garden/pool area was crowded.
1583	Staff were very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.
1583	The rooms are all suites and very spacious.
1583	We were initially given a room overlooking the garden area, this was a large suite but we wanted a view of The Strip and so were given a smaller room but with all the same amenities without any hassle.
1583	We also went to the Human Nature, Motown show, in The Venetian and it was fantastic - a great evening for any Motown fans.
1583	As the hotel is very big (typical Vegas style), it was difficult to found our way around.
1583	We didn't try the gondola ride as it was quite expensive about $40 per person.
1583	Overall, we'd stay at The Venetian again!
1584	The hotel itself was lovely.
1584	We were charged £158 on arrival for room tax and deposit, after we had already paid for our stay via Expedia.
1584	It had to be with a card, we couldn't pay it cash.
1584	After that, every day, money was coming off my card.
1584	Because bits were being taken, I incured charges from the bank.
1584	On our final day, when packing, we realised that one of our bags had gone missing which contained various things that we had bought whilst in Las Vegas.
1584	Only me and my partner had been in the room, apart from the house keeper the day before.
1584	We only let the house keepers in twice during our stay, and the items were there after the first time they had been in.
1584	We checked out just after the realisation and told the lady at the desk.
1584	She told us that we had to go to another part of the hotel, however we did not have time as we had to get to the airport to catch one of our three flights home.
1584	She told me that I could email, but there is no customer service email available on the website for us to get in touch and no facebook or Twitter page.
1584	She also told me that we had been charged $180 for use of the mini bar, which has weight sensors in apparently.
1584	It is absolutely disgraceful.
1584	We didn't use anything in the mini bar, we put a drink or two of our own in there, as the prices were extortionate to use the mini bar.
1584	Also, the wi-fi was awful, but was fantastic in other hotels that we visited.
1584	I definitely will not be staying there again next time I go to Las Vegas.
1585	The Venetian is quite impressive overall.
1585	It's very clean and well-secured.
1585	It's massive in size and scope, and the architecture and amenities are excellent.
1585	It is still a bit overpriced, however.
1585	But it's one of the better options on The Strip, I'd say.
1585	The valet services is good.
1585	It's a bit too crowded, but that's also because it's popular with people.
1586	Our second time to the hotel and another good experience.
1586	Our kids love the pools and we will return for another visit.
1587	After recently visiting Italy I was pleassantly surprised at how realistic and true to the location the Venetian was.
1587	The  Venetian had all the amenities necessary to make it difficult to leave.
1587	My only complaint would be the pool area which I found slightly packed with a Hard Rock Cafe atmosphere.
1588	We stayed at the Venetian for 4 nights.
1588	The first two were not good - loud neighbours, but security dealt with them quickly after we called.
1588	To try and make up for the disruptive nights, our daily resort fee was waived for our entire stay.
1588	Pool selection is awesome - something for everyone and no need to get there at the crack of dawn to get a chair - plenty to choose from even into the early afternoon.
1588	Monorail station is next door at Harrah's, which was also convenient and much cheaper than cabbing up and down the strip.
1588	Bouchon Restaurant is great place for breakfast - nice patio outside to start the day.
1588	Would definitely come back.
1589	We travel to Las Vegas once per year and have stayed at a different hotel each time.
1589	We decided on The Venetian.
1589	Although the hotel is lovely, and the cost per night is more than some of the other hotels, we were surprised upon check in that if you want to have a view of the Strip, the additional cost per night is approximately $50.
1589	This is something that is not mentioned on the Expedia web site, nor on the Venetian web site.
1589	The pools are nice, but seating is extremely limited.
1589	The staff does a good job in making sure that if people are not seated at the pool and towels are left on chairs, they will remove them promptly.
1589	I know many of the hotels also charge a per night ""resort fee"" which allows for a newspaper (which you must pick up at the gift shop) and use of the fitness center.
1589	Overall, a nice hotel but watch out for the ""extras"".
1590	Nice arquitectural facility as a Venetian Building ,  but the gondola raid it is just a short, not well illuminated and the ladies that they work under the gondola control, they even know the Italian  lyrics song that tried to sing.
1590	Wi Fi is included in the day rate but is very  poor the connection.
1590	In the suites , the fridge not working properly we found the bottle and others things in room temperature.
1590	The phones only one was working.
1590	I ask front desk to change the room , i did, but still some issues in shower head for example, I ask one the front desk employee to put a note in my account about this issues but he never wrote something in there.
1590	No coffee maker in the room.
1590	Swimming pools  the have instead  three little whirlpools , it is incredible big facility with these little sinks instead of big ones.
1590	And you have to walk more than 15 min to get there, because the elevators are not working and the worst part  they close at 6pm those pools, incredible.
1590	I visited the Wynn Hotel, and this is a good hotel for my next trip.
1590	MGM has the best buffet in the strip.
1591	Good hotel but rooms are dark and old.
1591	Nothing to rave about.
1592	We enjoyed our stay,would love to return The holiday decorations were breathtaking.
1593	The Venetian Hotel has 3 towers; Venetian, Venezia, and Palazzo.
1593	The Venetian tower is the oldest, still very nice but 4-4.5 stars.
1593	I have not stayed in the other towers, but next time I will stay in the Palazzo tower.
1594	Great place, needs lots walking, easy get lost and bad wifi there.
1596	Check-in was smooth.
1596	Front desk staff great!
1598	Suite is so big & beautiful.
1598	I'll come back & stay here again.
1599	The staff was absolutely rude and awful
1600	Hotel is off the charts when it comes to cleanliness, rooms are A , pools, and location.
1600	The service in the restaurants we went to was not very good.
1600	That detracts from an otherwise great facility.
1601	Very friendly staff with an amazing room.
1601	It would be hard to stay anywhere else while in Vegas
1602	A wonderful experience from start to finish in this beautiful hotel.
1602	Able to check in at 11am which was great after a long plane ride.
1602	The staff was pleasant and accommodating.
1602	The restaurants and food in the hotel was good to great.
1602	The canal area with stores, restaurants and gondola rides was enjoyable and relaxing.
1602	Nice to not have to leave hotel and still have many things to do.
1603	very good location for shopping
1606	We will never back to this hotel , the worst experience my husband and me ever had with 5 star hotel we are booked Luxury 1 King Suite (non-smoking room) On arrival receptionist says that our room is not available and offer us completely different one We were not agree with this offer and finally we have been accommodated in our luxury king suite.
1606	In the room on the table was ashtray with stub of cigarettes and dust everywhere.
1606	No one helped us to bring your baggage to the room.
1606	During our stay in this hotel  housekeeper did not respect our privacy: she open door and start cleaning room when we are resting.
1608	Even the cheapest rooms are huge with a luxurious bathroom and lower level sitting area.
1608	The shopping area is pleasant to stroll around, the gondoliers are atmospheric, and the casino is large.
1608	One of the nicer hotels I've stayed at in Vegas.
1609	1 Bed suites are very spacious & nice.
1609	is the size of a 1 bedroom apt.
1609	Fixtures are dated & our shower leaked on to the bathroom floor.
1609	I called maintenance to repair but no one showed up.
1609	Not a big deal as we were there only 1 night.
1609	The hotel itself is nice but dated.
1609	The lobby is the nicest.
1609	The sister-property, The Palazzo, which The Venetian is connected to, makes the age stand out, as The Palazzo is really r-e-a-l-l-y nice.
1609	Overall, good value.
1610	The suite was enormous!
1610	Bathroom had a massive jacuzzi.
1610	Separate Dining area with TV and mini bar.
1610	Separate living area with TV and desk.
1610	King Size bed with dressing table and wardrobes and another plasma TV.
1610	Double Door entrance with a tiled floor hallway with guest toilet.
1610	A truly fantastic accommodation with great view from 35th floor.
1611	I have stayed at the Venetian probably 6-8 times over the past several years.
1611	This is the first time that I really saw a down turn in the property.
1611	The room we were initially assigned smelled so bad that we immediately had to change rooms.
1611	The 2nd room we were assigned did not smell but the mattress and the furniture were simply worn out and very uncomfortable.
1611	The overall room was disappointing.
1611	I have stayed at every major hotel on the strip.
1611	I cannot recommend this property to friends and family given the other similarly priced hotels on the strip.
1612	The location of the hotel on the strip was perfect for easy access to Wynn, Encore, Ceaser's, Bellagio, Palazo and Mirage.
1612	Having stayed at the MGM in the past I was very impressed at how much nicer The Venetian was and good value for money.
1614	Casino could be a little more vibrant, but it suites the style of Hotel.
1614	Plush, with no screaming kids or over alcohol induced adults.
1614	Very busy place, but nice to come back to.
1615	This was a great event!
1615	To celebrate your 21st birthday in Las Vegas is a dream come true.
1615	The Venetian was amazing and I would highly recommend it!
1616	I stay at the Venetian regularly when I go to Las Vegas and I always love it.
1616	The rooms are big and comfortable with all the necessary amenities.
1616	The restaurants within the hotel are great and the location is good for being fairly central.
1617	We stayed over the Easter Weekend...
1617	Room Service takes long time and replenishments were never refilled.
1617	We booked Venetian, but conveniently moved to Venezia which is worst than a corn maze...
1617	Front Desk was very helpful, but this hotel desires more in terms of support staff and needs easier access to rooms, garage, restaurants and casino
1618	My friend and I stayed in the Venetian for 4 nights at the end of our road trip from San Francisco.
1618	Two friends celebrating our birthdays in style.
1618	We had a suite on the 26th floor overlooking the pool and through a small peak of the strip were able to witness the Mirage Volcano erupt on the hour every hour.
1618	The suite was modern, airy and with enough space to raise a small farm yard...
1618	Everything about this hotel screams WOW.
1619	It was a great experience to live at the Venetian.
1619	I dont think anything else comes this close to a complete European experience of being in Venice in Italy.
1619	The Gondola rides are quite romantic for a pleasant evening with your date or spouse.
1619	The hotel staff is really welcoming and hospitable.
1619	Even the casino floor is good unlike some other hotels where the casinos just reeked of smell.
1619	The beach is nice but not as good as the Mandalay Bay.
1619	However, the Grand Canal Shoppes and the restaurants and really very good.
1619	It also has the Madammme tussads museum and getting a discounted tickets is just easy.
1619	The hotel is south of the strip making and close to the Mirage, Treasure Island, Wynn Encore hotels.
1619	The standard rooms are luxury suites, with a sink in living room and a very nice bathroom.
1619	It just had very pleasant feel for the guests.
1619	We did not get a chance to visit the night club but they say its one of the best in town.
1620	Great hotel, lots of activities, close to center of strip.
1620	Easy access to bus service on the strip.
1620	Beautiful pools and good dining.
1621	Views of the strip and mountains from the 29 th floor...
1621	The room is well laid out with sunk in living area, and a bed so comfortable, I thought I was in my own.
1621	Food cooked to perfection and served with class.
1621	Staff so pleasant and helpful, we felt welcomed as family and had never been to LV.
1621	Thank you Venetian for making our stay more than just a hotel stay!
1621	Truly lives up to its rating and reviews.
1623	incredible amenities, beautiful spacious room, great food and shopping
1624	It was a wonderful room.
1624	It was very clean and we could stay comfortablly.
1626	Stayed at the property for 3 nights - total of 3 rooms and family of 7. WoW what an amazing hotel and experience.
1626	Amazingly large rooms, great service, excellent furniture & fittings, enjoyable food and retail space.
1626	Didn't feel like leaving the property.
1626	Will go back again when I re-visit Vegas.
1627	The Venetian is HUGE!
1627	It took 3 days to become familiar with it.
1627	I loved the gondalas, and the multitude of shops and restaurants.
1627	The room was beautiful and comfortable.
1627	Bathroom was very nice, but not as magnificent as other places I have stayed.
1629	The Venetian is an excellent hotel for your Vegas experience.
1629	The facility is ultra Venice and the suites well appointed.
1629	Bedroom/ living area with two large flatscreen TV's and DVD player.
1629	Luxury 2 sink/ shower/bath with good range of toiletries.
1629	Shops and restaurants too numerous to mention to suit all tastes and prices.
1631	Rooms are very spacious and the first hotel to ever have a printer in my room!
1632	I had a twin bed room which required additional charges, total I paid for the room roughly around CAD220.
1632	-, the room was located on the 5 th floor, only one floor about the swimming pools and other facilities such as restaurants and Bars, not a good flooring.
1632	Swimming pools open only from 8am to 7 pm.
1632	Not long enough for guest who like to get some relax at the poolside in the evening.
1632	Overall, I would not recommended this hotel to anyone else I'd they wanted a present stay at Vegas.
1633	The hotel is quire beautiful  I had expected something a bit gaudy, distasteful even, but instead I found the colours and beautiful art work very restful and appealing.
1633	Our room was not nay spacious but very comfortable.
1633	The only negative is the lack of ability to make a cup of tea or coffee in our room.
1633	When you arrive late in the evening after 20 hours of international travel, the last thing you want to do is find a cafe for a much needed drink.
1634	Went in June,very hot, but  hotel was always cool.
1634	Food was great and room very comfortable.
1634	Vast  shoppinģ choices inside  hotel.
1635	Stayed at the Venetian for 4 nights, our room included the Breakfast for 2 each morning.
1635	The check-in process went quickly and as always the room was great.
1635	The process for ordering each morning was easy and the food was very good.
1635	After getting settled in we went and had dinner and at around 8:00pm we decided to go take a dip in the hot tub.
1635	To our surprise the pool area closed at 7:00pm.
1635	I have never stayed somewhere that the pool closed this early, could not believe we could not use the hot tub.
1635	The next day (Monday) we went to the pool to find the one closes to the Venetian closed.
1635	This left the other pool crowed and no seats near the pool.
1635	The pool by the Venetian was closed the whole time Monday - Thursday.
1635	This was very disappointing having to sit on top of each other when there is a whole pool area sitting empty.
1635	How much could a few extra life guards cost?
1636	We were at the Venetian during Christmas break.
1636	Everything was great except that the hotel seemed understaffed and we had to wait for almost everything...
1637	Overall Hotel experience was good, however, their concierge & room service need to improve further.
1637	Telephones in the room was not working so it took time before we could call our luggage in our room.
1637	The free $1000 voucher was not actualy a free vouchers...
1637	they just included a coupon booklet which needed a lot of spending to get the benefits...
1637	so it was moslty a marketing gimmick.
1639	This is my favorite hotel in Vegas.
1639	It's not the cheapest.
1639	But I have stayed at several hotels here over the years and this is the most comfortable.
1639	I will surely stay here when I return.
1640	Disappointed - Walls are very thin and sofa was very uncomfortable, nice hotel but not as good as I expected.
1640	I would try somewhere else.
1641	Had a very nice experience at the Venetian.
1641	It is a beautiful hotel, and I loved the shops, spa andetc.
1642	Amazing stay at the hotel, everything was excellent from start to finish
1643	We have stayed at the Venetian numerous times.
1643	We always enjoy ourselves.
1643	The service is exemplary.
1643	The concierges are very helpful, room service is excellent, and theres plenty of pools, bars and restaurants right in the hotel or close by.
1643	It was noticed that the rooms may be getting a little tired, just some basic wear and tear on upholstery etc., but nothing that was even worth mentioning.
1644	Loved everything, beautiful, romantic and everything you would expect.
1644	Only two draw backs 1: it's huge lots to see and tons of walking.
1644	2: after 10 pm casino is filled with prostitutes.
1645	From the moment we pulled up at the entrance of the hotel to the moment we left we all felt in the lap of luxury.
1645	This hotel is easily the largest we have ever stayed at but it never felt crowded.
1645	The food was plentiful, if a little more expensive than other American cities we have visited.
1645	We also visited a number of other hotels/casinos during our stay and in our view this was one of the best.
1646	When you stay at the Venetian there are plenty of perks.
1646	You can sort of skip the line when you go to the nightclub TAO.
1646	Everybody treats you with respect once they know you are a hotel guest at the Venetian.
1646	The rooms were out of sight.
1646	Made me feel like a king!
1647	Wonderful way to spend our 5th wedding anniversary.
1648	Excellent hotel, excellent restaurants, excellent service
1649	Great large clean room.
1649	Only problem was that I had to use the phone for a long distance call because my cell phone said it was roaming.
1649	A few minutes was $31.21 another call was $19.63.
1649	I thought that the $22.40 Resort Fee covered phone calls.
1649	Good thing I got my cell straighten out.
1649	I would stay there again, no question about it.
1650	Fun hotel with good atmosphere and shopping around the hotel.
1650	Easy access to other casinos and shopping.
