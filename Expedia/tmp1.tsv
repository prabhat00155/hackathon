1	the first room that they had us in had wet carpet so I am thinking something bad was on the carpet an they cleaned it before we got there but it was soaking wet in a large area.
1	The next room reeked of cigar smoke and had a huge air cleaning machine running in it.
1	Finally we got a remodeled room which was good but those not remodeled are are dirty looking and furniture is stained and filthy.
1	I guess what happens in Vegas...
